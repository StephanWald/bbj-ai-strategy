## Code Corrections

Fix hallucinated BBj code samples across all chapters using `GuideToGuiProgrammingInBBj.pdf` (project root) as the authoritative reference.

### Chapter 1: The BBj Challenge

- [ ] **CODE-01**: Replace hallucinated Visual PRO/5 `WINDOW CREATE`/`BUTTON CREATE` verb syntax with correct `PRINT (sysgui)'WINDOW'(x,y,w,h,"title",$flags$,$eventmask$)` mnemonic syntax. Three blocks affected (lines ~68-72, ~120-123, ~167-173).
- [ ] **CODE-02**: Fix DWC/BBj GUI code sample — `addWindow("Welcome", $01101000$)` missing coordinate parameters. Correct to `addWindow(x,y,w,h,"title")` signature per PDF reference.
- [ ] **CODE-03**: Fix `CTRL(wnd, n)` syntax — replace with correct `CTRL(sysgui, controlId, index)` channel-based syntax per PDF reference.
- [ ] **CODE-04**: Fix comparison table (line ~215) that incorrectly describes Visual PRO/5 as using `WINDOW CREATE`, `BUTTON CREATE` — update to reflect mnemonic-based approach.

### Cross-Chapter Audit

- [ ] **CODE-05**: Audit BBj code samples in Chapter 3 (Fine-Tuning) against PDF patterns — verify correct code, fix any hallucinated syntax. Currently has 1 BBj block (OrderForm class).
- [ ] **CODE-06**: Audit BBj code samples in Chapter 5 (Documentation Chat) against PDF patterns — verify correct code, fix any hallucinated syntax. Currently has 2 BBj blocks.
- [ ] **CODE-07**: Audit and correct any BBj code or Visual PRO/5 references in remaining chapters (2, 4, 6, 7) against PDF patterns.

### Reference Attribution

- [ ] **CODE-08**: Add reference/link to `GuideToGuiProgrammingInBBj.pdf` (or its canonical URL at documentation.basis.cloud) in Chapter 1 as authoritative source for BBj GUI patterns across generations.

## Custom Branding

Apply BASIS International brand identity to the documentation site.

- [ ] **BRAND-01**: Custom favicon using BASIS logo (replace Docusaurus default dinosaur)
- [ ] **BRAND-02**: Site logo in navbar/header using BASIS brand mark
- [ ] **BRAND-03**: Custom color theme (primary, secondary, accent colors) aligned with BASIS brand palette
- [ ] **BRAND-04**: Typography updates if BASIS brand specifies custom fonts
