# Requirements: BBj AI Strategy — v1.6 Data Expansion

**Defined:** 2026-02-05
**Core Value:** Expand RAG knowledge with structured API documentation and establish infrastructure for collecting curated training data that enables future BBj model fine-tuning.

## v1.6 Requirements

### BBjAPI JavaDoc Ingestion

- [x] **API-01**: JavaDoc JSON parser extracts classes, methods, parameters, and documentation from `$BBJ_HOME/documentation/javadoc/*.json`
- [x] **API-02**: Chunking preserves class-method relationships (each method chunk includes parent class context)
- [x] **API-03**: Documentation links (`[Docs](https://documentation.basis.cloud/...)`) extracted as `display_url` for citation
- [x] **API-04**: `bbj-ingest-all --source javadoc` ingests all 7 JSON files (359 classes, 4,438 methods)
- [x] **API-05**: Search queries for BBj API methods (e.g., "BBjWindow addButton") return relevant JavaDoc results

### Training Data Infrastructure

- [x] **TRAIN-01**: Training data repository structure created (directory layout, README, format specification)
- [x] **TRAIN-02**: Markdown format defined for annotated code examples (front matter, code blocks, explanations)
- [x] **TRAIN-03**: 1-2 seed examples created to validate format and workflow
- [x] **TRAIN-04**: Documentation for contributors on how to add new training examples

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status | Outcome |
|-------------|-------|--------|---------|
| API-01 | Phase 30 | ✓ Complete | JavaDocParser class parses all 7 JSON files |
| API-02 | Phase 30 | ✓ Complete | One Document per class with all methods listed |
| API-03 | Phase 30 | ✓ Complete | display_url extracted and preserved through pipeline |
| API-04 | Phase 30 | ✓ Complete | 695 chunks from 359 classes ingested |
| API-05 | Phase 30 | ✓ Complete | Search returns JavaDoc results (verified in code) |
| TRAIN-01 | Phase 31 | ✓ Complete | 7 topic directories + schema + scripts |
| TRAIN-02 | Phase 31 | ✓ Complete | FORMAT.md (263 lines) with full specification |
| TRAIN-03 | Phase 31 | ✓ Complete | 2 seed examples pass validation |
| TRAIN-04 | Phase 31 | ✓ Complete | CONTRIBUTING.md (215 lines) with workflow |

## Future Requirements (Tracked)

Deferred to later milestones:

### Additional Data Sources
- **DATA-F01**: Expanded BBj source code ingestion
- **DATA-F02**: Stack Overflow / community forum content
- **DATA-F03**: Third-party BBj tutorials and guides

### Training Data Expansion
- **TRAIN-F01**: Automated extraction of good examples from chat responses
- **TRAIN-F02**: Q&A pair collection for supervised fine-tuning
- **TRAIN-F03**: Conversion pipeline from Markdown to JSONL training format

### Fine-Tuning Pipeline
- **FINETUNE-F01**: JSONL conversion tooling for training data
- **FINETUNE-F02**: QLoRA training pipeline setup
- **FINETUNE-F03**: Model evaluation framework for BBj code generation

## Out of Scope (v1.6)

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Actual fine-tuning | v1.6 focuses on data collection infrastructure, not model training |
| Full BBj source code ingestion | Requires access controls and curation |
| JSONL conversion | Build when there's enough training data |
| Community content scraping | Legal/ethical review needed |
| Chat response extraction | Requires alpha usage first |
