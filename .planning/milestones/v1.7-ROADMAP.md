# Milestone v1.7: Documentation Refresh & Fine-Tuning Strategy

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-06
**Phases:** 32-36
**Total Plans:** 8

## Overview

v1.7 refreshes all 7 documentation chapters to reflect the actual state of the BBj AI strategy project as of February 2026. The biggest change is a research-backed rewrite of Chapter 3 (Fine-Tuning) incorporating findings from the bbjllm repo analysis — switching the recommendation from 7B-Base to 14B-Base, documenting the two-stage training approach, and adding evaluation methodology. Smaller updates correct status/tone across all chapters, update Chapter 4 (IDE Integration) with Continue.dev as the primary path, restructure Chapter 7's implementation roadmap against completed milestones, and ensure cross-chapter consistency for model names, tool status, and data counts.

## Phases

### Phase 32: Multi-Chapter Status & Tone Update

**Goal**: Readers of any chapter see an honest, current snapshot of what is operational versus what is planned
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: STAT-01, STAT-02, STAT-03, STAT-04, CHAT-01, CHAT-02
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 32-01-PLAN.md — Update status blocks and tone across chapters 1 and 2
- [x] 32-02-PLAN.md — Update status blocks, architecture, and tone across chapters 5 and 6

### Phase 33: Fine-Tuning Chapter Rewrite

**Goal**: Chapter 3 presents a research-backed fine-tuning strategy grounded in the actual bbjllm implementation and current (2026) best practices
**Depends on**: Phase 32 (status context established)
**Requirements**: FT-01, FT-02, FT-03, FT-04, FT-05, FT-06, FT-07, FT-08, FT-09
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 33-01-PLAN.md — Rewrite core content: TL;DR, bbjllm Foundation, Base Model Selection, Training Data pipeline, QLoRA+two-stage, Evaluation Methodology
- [x] 33-02-PLAN.md — Update Toolchain versions, add Training Workflow, update Hosting, replace Status block, full-file consistency pass

### Phase 34: IDE Integration Update

**Goal**: Chapter 4 presents a realistic near-term IDE integration path with Continue.dev rather than aspirational custom tooling
**Depends on**: Phase 33 (fine-tuning context needed for FIM discussion)
**Requirements**: IDE-01, IDE-02, IDE-03, IDE-04
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 34-01-PLAN.md — Core restructure: Continue.dev primary section with config walkthrough, FIM gap, Copilot reframe with comparison table
- [x] 34-02-PLAN.md — Language server repositioning, ghost text expansion, Langium AI recontextualization, status block, consistency pass

### Phase 35: Implementation Roadmap Restructure

**Goal**: Chapter 7 separates completed work (7 milestones) from credible forward plan, replacing the original speculative timeline
**Depends on**: Phase 33, Phase 34 (forward plan references fine-tuning and IDE decisions)
**Requirements**: ROAD-01, ROAD-02, ROAD-03, ROAD-04
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 35-01-PLAN.md -- Rewrite Chapter 7: delete speculative content, update comparison table, add component summary + forward plan

### Phase 36: Cross-Chapter Consistency Pass

**Goal**: All 7 chapters use consistent terminology, model names, tool status, and data counts -- a reader moving between chapters encounters no contradictions
**Depends on**: Phase 32, 33, 34, 35 (all content changes complete)
**Requirements**: CONS-01, CONS-02, CONS-03, CONS-04
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 36-01-PLAN.md — Cross-chapter consistency fixes (10 text corrections) and build gate verification

## Progress

**Execution Order:** 32 -> 33 -> 34 -> 35 -> 36

| Phase | Milestone | Plans Complete | Status | Completed |
|-------|-----------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| 32. Multi-Chapter Status & Tone Update | v1.7 | 2/2 | Complete | 2026-02-06 |
| 33. Fine-Tuning Chapter Rewrite | v1.7 | 2/2 | Complete | 2026-02-06 |
| 34. IDE Integration Update | v1.7 | 2/2 | Complete | 2026-02-06 |
| 35. Implementation Roadmap Restructure | v1.7 | 1/1 | Complete | 2026-02-06 |
| 36. Cross-Chapter Consistency Pass | v1.7 | 1/1 | Complete | 2026-02-06 |

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Base as primary recommendation (over 7B-Base and 32B-Instruct)
- Continue.dev as primary IDE integration path (over Copilot BYOK)
- Status terminology: operational / operational for internal exploration / active research / planned
- bbjcpl-based compile@1 as primary evaluation metric
- Two-stage training: continued pretraining then instruction fine-tuning
- Chapter 7 restructured as progress-and-plan (no timelines, phases, costs)
- CONS-04 accepted as low-risk: code blocks unmodified, bbjcpl unavailable

**Issues Resolved:**

- Stale model name references (7B→14B-Base) across 4 chapters
- Stale Chapter 7 cross-references in 4 chapters
- Inconsistent status terminology ("Under investigation"→"Active research")

**Issues Deferred:**

- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- CONS-04 (BBj code compilation) accepted as low-risk without running bbjcpl -- code blocks were validated in earlier milestones and not modified in v1.7
