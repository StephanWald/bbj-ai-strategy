## Cross-Phase Integration

**Integration Score:** 16/16 exports properly wired

### MCP Tool Wiring

All three MCP tools defined in Chapter 2 are consumed by downstream chapters:

| Tool | Defined In | Consumed By |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `search_bbj_knowledge` | Ch2 (lines 162-180) | Ch5, Ch6, Ch7 |
| `generate_bbj_code` | Ch2 (lines 182-201) | Ch3, Ch5, Ch7 |
| `validate_bbj_syntax` | Ch2 (lines 203-220) | Ch4, Ch5, Ch7 |

No orphaned tools. No schema duplication (0 instances of `inputSchema` outside Ch2).

### Pattern Wiring

| Pattern | Defined In | Referenced By |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Generate-validate-fix loop | Ch2 (lines 240-278) | Ch4, Ch5, Ch7 |
| Compiler validation via bbjcpl | Ch4 (lines 298-383) | Ch2, Ch7 |
| Two-path chat architecture | Ch5 (lines 55-186) | Ch2 (Three Initiatives) |

### Status Consistency

All chapters agree on project state:

| Fact | Ch2 | Ch3 | Ch4 | Ch5 | Ch6 | Ch7 |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| RAG v1.2 shipped | ✓ | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| ~10K training examples | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — | ✓ |
| MCP architecture defined | ✓ | — | — | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| bbjcpltool v1 validated | ✓ | — | ✓ | — | — | ✓ |

## E2E Reader Flows

**All 3 primary flows complete:**

| Flow | Path | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| Architecture → Validation → Roadmap | Landing → Ch2 → Ch4 → Ch7 | ✓ Complete |
| Chat → MCP Tools → RAG | Landing → Ch5 → Ch2 → Ch6 | ✓ Complete |
| Fine-Tuning → MCP → Roadmap | Landing → Ch3 → Ch2 → Ch7 | ✓ Complete |

All cross-references resolve. Terminology consistent at every stop. No narrative breaks.

## Build Verification

- Docusaurus build: zero errors, zero warnings
- Cross-reference links: 88 total, all resolving
- JSON schemas: 3 valid
- Mermaid diagrams: 13 valid
- BBj code blocks: 17 validated via bbjcpl -N
- Decision callouts: 17, all with four required fields

## Tech Debt

**None.** No deferred items, no TODOs, no stubs, no placeholders found across any of the five phases.

## Anti-Patterns

**None found** across all five phase verifications:
- 0 TODO/FIXME comments
- 0 placeholder content
- 0 stub implementations
- 0 incorrect technology references

## Conclusion

Milestone v1.3 achieved its goal. The MCP server architecture, compiler validation concept, and ecosystem integration are woven coherently into all seven chapters. Three audiences (developers, leadership, customers) can follow any reading path and encounter consistent MCP framing, accurate project status, and properly linked cross-references. The site builds clean and all content validates.
