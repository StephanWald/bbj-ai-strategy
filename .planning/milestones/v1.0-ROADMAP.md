# Milestone v1.0: BBj AI Strategy Documentation Site

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-31
**Phases:** 1-5
**Total Plans:** 15

## Overview

This roadmap delivers a Docusaurus documentation site that communicates BASIS International's BBj AI strategy to three audiences (developers, leadership, customers). Work flows from scaffolding and deployment pipeline, through content architecture patterns, into two phases of chapter authoring (foundation then execution topics), and finishes with search, SEO, and launch polish. Each phase produces a verifiable, deployable increment.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Scaffold & Deploy Pipeline
**Goal**: A working Docusaurus site with correct chapter structure deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to main
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: SCAF-01, SCAF-02, SCAF-03, SCAF-04
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md -- Scaffold Docusaurus with Rspack, configure for GitHub Pages, create 7-chapter folder structure with placeholders
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md -- Create GitHub Actions deploy/test workflows, push to main, verify live deployment

### Phase 2: Content Architecture & Landing Page
**Goal**: Visitors land on a professional landing page with audience routing, and content patterns (TL;DR blocks, decision callouts, Mermaid diagrams) are ready for chapter authoring
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: ARCH-01, ARCH-02, ARCH-03, ARCH-04
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md -- Redesign landing page with problem-first hero, executive summary, audience routing cards, and chapter grid
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md -- Install Mermaid theme, create admonition CSS for TL;DR and decision callouts, demonstrate all patterns in sample chapters

### Phase 3: Foundation Chapters
**Goal**: A reader can understand why BBj needs a custom AI strategy, what the unified architecture looks like, and how the model will be fine-tuned -- through three researched, well-structured chapters with proper BBj syntax highlighting
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: CONT-01, CONT-02, CONT-03, SCAF-05
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md -- Configure BBj syntax highlighting and rename Chapter 1 to .mdx for Tabs support
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md -- Research and write Chapter 1: The BBj Challenge
- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md -- Research and write Chapter 2: Strategic Architecture
- [x] 03-04-PLAN.md -- Research and write Chapter 3: Fine-Tuning the Model

### Phase 4: Execution Chapters
**Goal**: All 7 chapters are complete with current best practices, execution guidance, and decision rationale
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: CONT-04, CONT-05, CONT-06, CONT-07, CONT-08, CONT-09, CONT-10
**Plans**: 5 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md -- Write Chapter 4: IDE Integration
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md -- Write Chapter 5: Documentation Chat
- [x] 04-03-PLAN.md -- Write Chapter 6: RAG Database Design
- [x] 04-04-PLAN.md -- Write Chapter 7: Implementation Roadmap
- [x] 04-05-PLAN.md -- Cross-chapter quality pass

### Phase 5: Search, SEO & Launch
**Goal**: The site is discoverable, navigable, and ready for public sharing with full-text search, proper link previews, and verified production deployment
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Requirements**: NAV-01, NAV-02, NAV-03, NAV-04
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md -- Install search plugin, configure OG meta tags, create robots.txt
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md -- Fix sidebar_position values, verify navigation, deploy to GitHub Pages

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Docusaurus with Rspack over alternatives (fast builds, React-based, good theming)
- GitHub Pages deployment under StephanWald account
- Problem-first landing page hero ("Generic LLMs Fail on BBj")
- Audience routing via inline cards, not separate landing pages
- BBj Prism grammar ships with PrismJS (no custom grammar needed)
- Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Base as primary base model recommendation
- QLoRA via Unsloth as training approach ($1,500 GPU)
- Two-layer completion architecture (Langium deterministic + LLM generative)
- pgvector as default vector store for BBj corpus
- Text-only social previews (no custom image), removed Docusaurus defaults

**Issues Resolved:**

- Rspack deprecation warning (cosmetic, no action needed)
- sidebar_position values corrected from all `1` to explicit `1-7`
- upload-pages-artifact v3 needed (not v4) to preserve .nojekyll

**Issues Deferred:**

- Favicon still shows Docusaurus default (no BASIS logo available)
- Dark mode not custom-branded (standard Docusaurus dark mode works)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- None significant
