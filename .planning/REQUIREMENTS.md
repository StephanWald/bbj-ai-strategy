# Requirements: BBj AI Strategy Documentation Site

**Defined:** 2026-01-31
**Core Value:** Stakeholders can understand the BBj AI strategy, why it's necessary, and how it will be executed -- through a well-structured, publicly accessible documentation site.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Scaffold

- [x] **SCAF-01**: Docusaurus 3.9.2 project initialized with Rspack (`@docusaurus/faster`) for fast builds
- [x] **SCAF-02**: 7-chapter folder structure with numbered prefixes and autogenerated sidebar
- [x] **SCAF-03**: GitHub Actions workflow deploys site to GitHub Pages on push to main
- [x] **SCAF-04**: `baseUrl` and `trailingSlash` configured correctly for GitHub Pages
- [ ] **SCAF-05**: Custom BBj syntax highlighting via Prism grammar so code examples render properly

### Content Architecture

- [ ] **ARCH-01**: Landing page with executive summary and audience routing (developers, leadership, customers)
- [ ] **ARCH-02**: TL;DR summary blocks at the top of each chapter for quick orientation
- [ ] **ARCH-03**: Decision record callouts highlighting key strategic choices and their rationale
- [ ] **ARCH-04**: Mermaid diagrams replacing ASCII art for architecture visualizations

### Content Chapters

- [ ] **CONT-01**: Chapter 1 — The BBj Challenge: 4 generations explained, why generic LLMs fail, contrast with webforJ
- [ ] **CONT-02**: Chapter 2 — Strategic Architecture: unified AI infrastructure vision, shared model + RAG
- [ ] **CONT-03**: Chapter 3 — Fine-Tuning the Model: training data structure, base model selection, hosting via Ollama, LoRA approach
- [ ] **CONT-04**: Chapter 4 — IDE Integration: VSCode extension + Langium, ghost text vs popup completion, generation-aware prompts
- [ ] **CONT-05**: Chapter 5 — Documentation Chat: website chat system, why generic services fail, generation-aware responses
- [ ] **CONT-06**: Chapter 6 — RAG Database Design: multi-generation document structure, retrieval strategy, metadata schema
- [ ] **CONT-07**: Chapter 7 — Implementation Roadmap: phases, resource requirements, risk assessment, success metrics
- [ ] **CONT-08**: Each chapter researched for current best practices and rewritten (not just copied from paper)
- [ ] **CONT-09**: How-to / execution guidance added where original paper is abstract
- [ ] **CONT-10**: Current status and decision rationale reflected in each chapter

### Search & Navigation

- [ ] **NAV-01**: Local search plugin (`@easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local`) for full-text search
- [ ] **NAV-02**: Chapter pagination (previous/next) between pages
- [ ] **NAV-03**: Table of contents per page from headings
- [ ] **NAV-04**: Open Graph and SEO meta tags for proper link previews

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Enhanced Content

- **ENH-01**: Audience-specific badges/tags on sections (developer, leadership, customer)
- **ENH-02**: Interactive code comparison tabs (legacy vs modern BBj side-by-side)
- **ENH-03**: Glossary page with cross-linked definitions
- **ENH-04**: Appendix pages for training data schemas and generation quick reference

### Analytics & Feedback

- **ANLYT-01**: Page view analytics to understand which chapters get read
- **ANLYT-02**: Feedback mechanism on pages (helpful/not helpful)

### Visual Polish

- **VIS-01**: Custom theme colors and branding aligned with BASIS International
- **VIS-02**: Custom favicon and logo
- **VIS-03**: Dark mode support

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Authentication / access control | Site is fully public |
| Interactive demos or live chat widget | This documents the strategy, not the AI system itself |
| Building actual AI infrastructure | Separate project -- this is documentation only |
| Multi-language / i18n | English only, unnecessary complexity |
| Blog section | Strategy docs, not ongoing blog content |
| Versioned docs | Single version of the strategy -- updates happen in place |
| Algolia DocSearch | Overkill for 7-chapter site; local search sufficient |
| Mobile app | Standard Docusaurus responsive design is sufficient |
