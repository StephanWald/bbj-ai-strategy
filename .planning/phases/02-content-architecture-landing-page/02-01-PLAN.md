<objective>
Redesign the landing page with a problem-first narrative, executive summary, and audience routing cards that direct developers, leadership, and customers to relevant chapters.

Purpose: The landing page is the first thing visitors see. It must immediately communicate what BBj is, why generic AI tools fail on it, and what this strategy proposes -- then route visitors to content relevant to their role.

Output: Fully redesigned `src/pages/index.tsx` and `src/pages/index.module.css` with hero section, executive summary, audience routing cards, and refined chapter grid.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Redesign landing page layout and content</name>
  <files>src/pages/index.tsx, src/pages/index.module.css</files>
  <action>
Rewrite `src/pages/index.tsx` with the following four-section structure. Keep using the existing imports (`Link`, `Layout`, `Heading`, `useDocusaurusContext`, `clsx`) and CSS module pattern.

**Section 1 -- Hero (problem-first):**
- Headline: something like "Generic LLMs Fail on BBj" (the exact wording is at Claude's discretion, but it must lead with the problem)
- Subheadline: the site tagline from `useDocusaurusContext().siteConfig.tagline` (already "Intelligent Code Assistance Across Four Generations of Business BASIC")
- Brief 1-2 sentence hook under the subheadline: explain that BBj is too rare for generic AI training data, so a custom strategy is needed
- Primary CTA button: "Read the Strategy" linking to `/docs/bbj-challenge`
- Use `hero hero--primary` styling like the current page, but expand the content

**Section 2 -- Executive Summary:**
- 2-3 paragraphs that explain:
  1. What BBj is (four generations of Business BASIC, from 1980s character UIs to modern browser-based DWC apps, still powering production systems)
  2. The core problem (generic LLMs hallucinate BBj code because training data is near-zero; Copilot and ChatGPT cannot help)
  3. The solution (three integrated initiatives sharing a unified AI infrastructure)
- Three "initiative cards" in a row:
  1. Fine-Tuned BBj Model -- LoRA-trained model hosted via Ollama, understands all four generations
  2. IDE Integration -- VSCode extension with Langium for intelligent completions
  3. Documentation Chat -- Generation-aware answers embedded in the docs site
- Each initiative card should have a title, brief description (1-2 sentences), and no link (these are informational, not navigation)

**Section 3 -- Audience Routing:**
- Section heading: "Find What Matters to You" or similar
- Three audience cards:
  1. "For Developers" -- "How the fine-tuned model, IDE extension, and RAG pipeline work -- technical depth for implementers." Links to: Fine-Tuning the Model (`/docs/fine-tuning`), IDE Integration (`/docs/ide-integration`), RAG Database Design (`/docs/rag-database`)
  2. "For Leadership" -- "Strategic vision, architecture decisions, and implementation roadmap -- the business case for BBj AI." Links to: Strategic Architecture (`/docs/strategic-architecture`), The BBj Challenge (`/docs/bbj-challenge`), Implementation Roadmap (`/docs/implementation-roadmap`)
  3. "For Customers & Partners" -- "What this means for your BBj applications -- the developer experience improvements ahead." Links to: The BBj Challenge (`/docs/bbj-challenge`), Strategic Architecture (`/docs/strategic-architecture`), Implementation Roadmap (`/docs/implementation-roadmap`)
- Each audience card has a title, description, and 3 chapter links (using `<Link>` component)
- Cards should be visually distinct from the chapter grid -- larger, with the links listed inside

**Section 4 -- Chapter Overview (refine existing):**
- Keep the existing `chapters` data array and `ChapterOverview` component
- Add a section heading: "All Chapters" or "Strategy Overview"
- Keep the card grid layout, but add chapter numbers (1-7) visually to each card

**Styling rules:**
- All internal links MUST use `<Link>` from `@docusaurus/Link` (never raw `<a>` tags)
- Use CSS module classes for all custom styling (no inline styles)
- Responsive: initiative cards and audience cards should stack on mobile (1 column) and show in a row on desktop (3 columns)
- Maintain dark mode compatibility -- use Infima CSS variables (`--ifm-color-*`) for colors, not hardcoded values
- Tone: technical authority voice per CONTEXT.md -- confident, not salesy
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` from the project root -- must complete with zero errors. Then run `npm run serve` and visually confirm the landing page loads with all four sections visible.
  </verify>
  <done>
Landing page has hero with problem-first narrative, executive summary with three initiative cards, three audience routing cards with chapter links, and numbered chapter overview grid. All links use Docusaurus Link component. Page renders correctly in both light and dark mode. Build succeeds.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Redesigned landing page with problem-first hero, executive summary, audience routing for three audiences, and chapter overview grid</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Run `npm run serve` in the project root
2. Open http://localhost:3000/bbj-ai-strategy/ in your browser
3. Verify:
   - Hero section leads with the BBj problem (not just a title)
   - Executive summary explains BBj, the problem, and the three-initiative solution
   - Three initiative cards show (Fine-Tuned Model, IDE Integration, Documentation Chat)
   - Three audience routing cards show with chapter links for Developers, Leadership, Customers
   - Chapter overview grid shows all 7 chapters with numbers
   - All links navigate correctly (click a few to confirm)
   - Toggle dark mode (if your browser supports it) -- layout and colors should adapt
4. Check mobile responsiveness: resize browser to narrow width, cards should stack
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" or describe any layout/content issues to fix</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `npm run build` completes with zero errors
- Landing page renders at the site root URL with all four sections
- All internal links use `<Link>` component (grep for `<a href` in index.tsx -- should find none for internal links)
- Page is responsive (stacks on mobile, grid on desktop)
- Dark mode renders correctly
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Landing page shows problem-first hero, executive summary with three initiative cards, three audience routing cards, and chapter overview
- A visitor unfamiliar with BBj can understand what the site is about from the landing page alone
- All navigation links work correctly on the deployed build
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/02-content-architecture-landing-page/02-01-SUMMARY.md`
