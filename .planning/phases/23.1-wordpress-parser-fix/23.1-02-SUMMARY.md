# Phase 23.1 Plan 02: README Documentation Summary

**Comprehensive README with Docker Compose setup, REST API curl reference, and MCP server Claude Desktop configuration**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-02T12:01:32Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-02T12:03:55Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Docker Usage section with Quick Start, environment variables reference, and ingestion commands (local vs Docker side-by-side)
- REST API documentation for all three endpoints (/search, /health, /stats) with curl examples and response schemas
- MCP Server section with Claude Desktop JSON configuration and architecture diagram
- All-Source Ingestion section documenting the bbj-ingest-all CLI with full options table

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add Docker Usage section to README** - `c6108d3` (docs)
2. **Task 2: Add REST API and MCP Server sections to README** - `cdb20da` (docs, included in concurrent plan-01 commit due to pre-commit hook stash conflict)

## Files Created/Modified

- `rag-ingestion/README.md` - Added Docker Usage, REST API, and MCP Server sections (~280 lines of new documentation)

## Decisions Made

- Documented Docker as the primary deployment path, with local CLI as the secondary/development path
- Included full request/response schemas for the /search endpoint (not just curl commands)
- Showed the MCP architecture flow as an ASCII diagram for quick understanding
- Added bbj-ingest-all documentation in the local Usage section since it was previously undocumented

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 2 - Missing Critical] Added bbj-ingest-all documentation to local Usage section**
- **Found during:** Task 1 (Docker Usage section)
- **Issue:** The plan focused on Docker vs local side-by-side, but the local `bbj-ingest-all` command was completely undocumented in the existing README
- **Fix:** Added an "All-Source Ingestion" subsection under the existing Usage section with options table and examples
- **Files modified:** rag-ingestion/README.md
- **Verification:** bbj-ingest-all appears 7 times across both local and Docker contexts
- **Committed in:** c6108d3 (Task 1 commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (1 missing critical)
**Impact on plan:** Essential for completeness -- cannot document Docker equivalents without documenting the local command first. No scope creep.

## Issues Encountered

- Pre-commit hook stash/restore conflict caused Task 2 changes to be included in a concurrent plan-01 commit (`cdb20da`) rather than getting their own dedicated commit. The content is correct and complete in the repository; only the commit boundary was affected.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- README is now a complete guide from zero to running searches
- Ready for Plan 03 (remaining tasks in phase 23.1)
- No blockers
