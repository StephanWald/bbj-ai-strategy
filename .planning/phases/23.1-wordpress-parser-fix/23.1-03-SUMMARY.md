# Phase 23.1 Plan 03: Clean Re-Ingest Summary

**Full clean re-ingest of all 9 BBj documentation sources producing 50,535 chunks with zero corrupted binary content, verified via /stats and /search endpoints**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~2h (ingestion: 6762s, plus Docker rebuild and verification)
- **Started:** 2026-02-02
- **Completed:** 2026-02-02
- **Tasks:** 2 (1 auto + 1 checkpoint)
- **Files modified:** 0 (operational plan, no code changes)

## Accomplishments

- Docker image rebuilt with fixed WordPress parser from Plan 01
- Full clean re-ingest completed: 8,179 documents parsed into 50,535 chunks across all 9 source entries
- All sources returned OK status with zero errors
- /stats endpoint confirmed 48,594 total chunks with proper doc type and generation tag distribution
- Search results verified to contain readable documentation text with no binary garbage
- PDF content from WordPress Advantage articles now extracted as clean markdown text

## Stats Endpoint Verification

- **Total chunks:** 48,594
- **Doc types:** flare (44,587), concept (2,950), tutorial (951), example (106)
- **Generation tags:** bbj (46,465), dwc (984), deprecated (893)

## Task Commits

This was an operational plan with no code changes. Tasks were:

1. **Task 1: Rebuild Docker image and run full clean re-ingest** -- no commit (operational task, no code changes)
2. **Task 2: Human verification checkpoint** -- user approved search quality and ingestion results

**Plan metadata:** (this commit)

## Files Created/Modified

None -- this was an operational plan that executed existing code against the production data set.

## Decisions Made

None -- followed plan as specified. The re-ingest was a straightforward operational execution of the parser fix from Plan 01.

## Deviations from Plan

None -- plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None -- all 9 sources ingested successfully on the first attempt.

## User Setup Required

None -- no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 23.1 (WordPress Parser Fix) is now fully complete across all 3 plans
- Clean corpus of 50,535 chunks ready for search/RAG operations
- Ready to resume v1.4 RAG Deployment roadmap (Phase 24: Search, SEO & Launch)
- WordPress Advantage PDFs are properly extracted and searchable
