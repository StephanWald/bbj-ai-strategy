<objective>
Cross-cutting quality pass across all 7 chapters: retrofit Current Status sections to Chapters 1-3, update Chapter 3's outdated training data claims, audit cross-references across all chapters, and verify content pattern consistency.

Purpose: Ensures the entire site reads as a cohesive document rather than 7 independent chapters. After this pass, every chapter has an honest Current Status section, cross-references flow naturally between related topics, and no outdated claims remain.

Output: Updated Chapters 1-3 with Current Status sections, updated Chapter 3 with corrected training data status, and verified cross-reference consistency.

**Read all 7 chapters first** to understand the current state. Then make targeted updates to Chapters 1-3.

**Chapter 1 (docs/01-bbj-challenge/index.mdx) -- Add Current Status section:**
Add a "## Current Status" section at the end of the chapter (before any closing content), using the :::note[Where Things Stand -- January 2026] pattern. Content:
- Shipped: The bbj-language-server brings Langium-powered IDE features to VSCode (syntax highlighting, completion, diagnostics)
- In progress: Fine-tuned model on Qwen2.5-Coder-7B with ~10,000 training examples showing promising results
- The strategy in this document is being actively implemented, not just planned
- Brief pointer: "The chapters that follow detail each component of the strategy."

**Chapter 2 (docs/02-strategic-architecture/index.md) -- Add Current Status section:**
Add a "## Current Status" section at the end. Content:
- Shipped: The language server (shared foundation consumer #1) is on the VS Code Marketplace
- In progress: Fine-tuned model (shared foundation core) is being trained with ~10K data points
- In progress: Copilot integration being explored as an interim bridge
- Planned: RAG pipeline (shared foundation component #2), documentation chat
- The unified architecture is being built incrementally -- foundation first, consumers next

**Chapter 3 (docs/03-fine-tuning/index.md) -- Update existing Current Status section:**
The existing Current Status section at the bottom of Chapter 3 contains OUTDATED information. It says:
- "Training data: Schema and generation labeling system are defined. No curated examples exist yet."
- "Base model: No fine-tuning experiments have been run."
- "Toolchain: No integration testing of the full pipeline has been performed."

UPDATE this section to reflect CURRENT reality (from CONTEXT.md):
- Training data: ~10,000 training examples have been curated. The generation labeling system is in use. Results are promising and ongoing expansion continues.
- Base model: Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Base selected and actively being fine-tuned. Experiments are producing promising results.
- Toolchain: Pipeline validated through active use. Fine-tuning workflow operational.
- Hosting: Ollama infrastructure validated and in use for evaluation.

Also update the Decision callout in the "Volume and Quality Targets" section if it says "Status: Training data schema defined. Curation tooling not yet built." -- update to reflect that ~10K examples exist.

Also add cross-references to Chapters 4-7 where natural:
- In the opening paragraph or after Current Status, add forward references to IDE integration (Chapter 4) and documentation chat (Chapter 5) as consumers of the fine-tuned model
- Ensure the existing reference to Chapter 7 (implementation roadmap) still works

**Do NOT change the chapter structure, tone, or non-outdated content.** These are surgical updates to specific outdated claims and the addition of Current Status sections.

  <verify>
Run `npm run build` from the project root. Build must pass with zero errors. Then verify:
1. Chapter 1 has Current Status: `grep -c "Current Status" docs/01-bbj-challenge/index.mdx`
2. Chapter 2 has Current Status: `grep -c "Current Status" docs/02-strategic-architecture/index.md`
3. Chapter 3 no longer says "No curated examples": `grep -c "No curated examples" docs/03-fine-tuning/index.md` returns 0
4. Chapter 3 references ~10K data: `grep -c "10,000\|10K\|10k" docs/03-fine-tuning/index.md`
5. All chapters still build: `npm run build` zero errors
  </verify>
  <done>
Chapters 1-3 all have Current Status sections. Chapter 3's outdated training data claims are corrected to reflect ~10K examples and active fine-tuning. No structural changes to existing content.

  <name>Task 2: Cross-reference audit across all 7 chapters</name>
  <files>docs/01-bbj-challenge/index.mdx, docs/02-strategic-architecture/index.md, docs/03-fine-tuning/index.md</files>
  <action>
Read all 7 chapters and audit cross-references. For each chapter, verify it links to at least 2-3 other chapters where topics are related. Add missing cross-references as natural inline links (not a forced "See Also" section).

**Expected cross-reference map (minimum):**

Chapter 1 (BBj Challenge) should link to:
- /docs/fine-tuning (the solution to the training data problem)
- /docs/strategic-architecture (the unified approach)

Chapter 2 (Strategic Architecture) should link to:
- /docs/bbj-challenge (the problem it addresses)
- /docs/fine-tuning (shared foundation: model)
- /docs/ide-integration (consumer application)
- /docs/documentation-chat (consumer application)
- /docs/rag-database (shared foundation: retrieval)

Chapter 3 (Fine-Tuning) should link to:
- /docs/bbj-challenge (why fine-tuning is needed)
- /docs/strategic-architecture (where it fits)
- /docs/ide-integration (consumer of model)
- /docs/documentation-chat (consumer of model)
- /docs/implementation-roadmap (timeline)

**Process:**
1. Read each chapter and grep for existing /docs/ links
2. Compare against the expected map above
3. Add missing links as natural inline references in existing paragraphs or in the Current Status section
4. Do NOT add links that feel forced -- only add where the text naturally references another topic

**Only modify Chapters 1-3** in this task (Chapters 4-7 were written with cross-references by plans 04-01 through 04-04). Focus on adding forward references from Chapters 1-3 to Chapters 4-7.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` from the project root. Build must pass with zero errors. Then verify:
1. Chapter 1 cross-refs: `grep -c "/docs/" docs/01-bbj-challenge/index.mdx` (should be 2+)
2. Chapter 2 cross-refs: `grep -c "/docs/" docs/02-strategic-architecture/index.md` (should be 3+)
3. Chapter 3 cross-refs: `grep -c "/docs/" docs/03-fine-tuning/index.md` (should be 3+)
4. No broken links: `npm run build` with zero errors (Docusaurus throws on broken links)
  </verify>
  <done>
All 7 chapters have natural cross-references to related chapters. Chapters 1-3 link forward to execution chapters (4-7). No broken links. The site reads as a cohesive document.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `npm run build` passes with zero errors
- All 7 chapters have Current Status sections
- Chapter 3 no longer contains outdated "no curated examples" claims
- Chapter 3 reflects ~10K training data points and active fine-tuning
- Chapters 1-3 have forward references to Chapters 4-7
- No broken links (Docusaurus enforces this via onBrokenLinks: 'throw')
</verification>

<success_criteria>
The entire 7-chapter site reads as a cohesive strategy document. Every chapter has an honest Current Status, every chapter cross-references related chapters, and no chapter contains outdated claims from the January 2025 paper. A reader navigating from any chapter can find their way to related content.
