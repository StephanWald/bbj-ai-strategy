<objective>
Write Chapter 7: Implementation Roadmap -- presenting phased implementation with MVP checkpoints, infrastructure costs, a formal risk assessment, and measurable success metrics. Anchored in the current state (language server shipped, fine-tuning in progress) rather than starting from zero.

Purpose: Chapter 7 is for technical leads and project managers evaluating whether this strategy is feasible and how to execute it. It synthesizes the technical details from Chapters 3-6 into an actionable plan with clear costs, risks, and success criteria.

Output: Complete Chapter 7 replacing the current placeholder (~14 lines) with a researched, execution-depth chapter (~300-400 lines).

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write Chapter 7 -- Implementation Roadmap</name>
  <files>docs/07-implementation-roadmap/index.md</files>
  <action>
Read the source material and research, then replace the placeholder content in docs/07-implementation-roadmap/index.md with a complete chapter.

**Source material to absorb before writing:**
1. bbj-llm-strategy.md lines 751-894 (Implementation Roadmap, Resource Requirements, Risk Assessment, Success Metrics)
2. .planning/phases/04-execution-chapters/04-RESEARCH.md -- Chapter 7 sections (Updated Current Status table, Roadmap Structure, Risk Assessment Framework, Infrastructure Cost Framework)
3. .planning/phases/04-execution-chapters/04-CONTEXT.md -- Chapter 7 framing: primary audience is technical leads/PMs, single recommended plan with cut points, hardware costs only (no staffing), formal risk assessment

**Required structure (follow this order):**

1. **Frontmatter** -- keep sidebar_position: 1, update description
2. **TL;DR block** (:::tip[TL;DR]) -- 2-3 sentences: phased roadmap with MVP checkpoints, building on shipped language server and in-progress fine-tuning, infrastructure cost ~$1,500-5,000 one-time plus minimal monthly
3. **Opening paragraph** -- Frame as the execution chapter that turns strategy into action. Reference Chapters 3-6 as the technical blueprints; this chapter provides the when, how much, and what could go wrong. Note the primary audience (technical leads, project managers).
4. **Where We Stand** -- Updated current status table from RESEARCH.md comparing Paper Status (Jan 2025) vs Actual Status (Jan 2026) for each component. This section grounds the roadmap in reality -- we are NOT starting from zero. Decision callout: acknowledging existing work changes the roadmap from 6-month full project to building on a partially-complete foundation.
5. **Implementation Phases** -- Mermaid diagram from RESEARCH.md (graph LR with 4 phases and MVP checkpoints). Then detail each phase:

   **Phase 1: Model Validation (Current -- Partially Complete)**
   - Continue fine-tuning with expanded dataset (building on ~10K data points)
   - Establish evaluation benchmarks (BBj-specific + general code)
   - Validate model quality for IDE completion use case
   - MVP checkpoint: model generates syntactically valid BBj 95%+ of the time

   **Phase 2: IDE Integration**
   - Integrate LLM completion into bbj-language-server
   - Implement generation detection in Langium parser
   - Build semantic context extraction API
   - MVP checkpoint: ghost text completions available in VS Code extension

   **Phase 3: RAG Pipeline + Documentation Chat**
   - Build MadCap Flare ingestion pipeline
   - Set up pgvector with generation-tagged chunks
   - Build chat backend with hybrid retrieval
   - MVP checkpoint: chat answers generation-appropriate questions with citations

   **Phase 4: Refinement + Scaling**
   - Expand training data based on user feedback
   - Optimize retrieval quality and latency
   - Production deployment hardening
   - MVP checkpoint: all components production-ready

   For each phase: objectives, key deliverables, success criteria, and the MVP checkpoint (explicit: "you could stop here and have [value]").

6. **Infrastructure Costs** -- Table from RESEARCH.md: training GPU ($1,500 purchase or $2-5K cloud), Ollama server (existing hardware), pgvector ($0-200/mo), chat backend ($50-200/mo), embedding computation ($10-50 one-time). Decision callout: hardware/infrastructure costs only, no staffing estimates (rationale: staffing varies too much by organization).

7. **Risk Assessment** -- Use the NIST AI RMF reference for credibility. Standard likelihood x impact matrix. Include all 6 risks from RESEARCH.md (hallucination, insufficient training data, Copilot changes, MadCap Flare parsing, model size for customers, LLM ecosystem shifts). Add a brief paragraph about the NIST AI Risk Management Framework as the methodology reference.

8. **Success Metrics** -- Three categories from the strategy paper, updated with RESEARCH.md improvements:
   - Technical: completion latency, syntactically valid completions, generation detection accuracy, hallucination rate, RAG Precision@K (target 0.85+), Answer Rate (target 0.90+)
   - User: completion acceptance rate (>20%), chat satisfaction (>4/5), feature adoption (>50% active users)
   - Business: customer retention, onboarding time reduction, migration acceleration

   Frame as aspirational targets to evaluate against, not promises.

9. **Current Status** -- :::note[Where Things Stand -- January 2026] admonition. Summarize: Phase 1 partially complete (language server shipped, model fine-tuning in progress). Phases 2-4 planned. Total infrastructure investment modest (~$2,000-5,000 one-time).

10. **Cross-references** -- Link to all previous chapters: /docs/bbj-challenge (the problem), /docs/strategic-architecture (the approach), /docs/fine-tuning (Phase 1 technical detail), /docs/ide-integration (Phase 2 technical detail), /docs/documentation-chat (Phase 3 technical detail), /docs/rag-database (Phase 3 technical detail).

**Content patterns to follow:**
- :::tip[TL;DR] at top
- At least 2 :::info[Decision: ...] callouts (acknowledging existing work, infrastructure costs only)
- At least 1 Mermaid diagram (implementation phases)
- Tables for costs, risks, metrics
- Architecture-first framing
- No "Coming Soon" text

**What to AVOID:**
- Do NOT start the roadmap from zero -- acknowledge shipped language server and ~10K training data points
- Do NOT include staffing/personnel estimates (per CONTEXT.md: hardware/infrastructure only)
- Do NOT include the original paper's $150K-250K development cost estimate
- Do NOT present timelines in months from start -- use phase numbers with MVP checkpoints
- Do NOT reference CodeLlama or StarCoder2 as candidates (outdated -- Qwen2.5-Coder is selected)
- Do NOT make the chapter shorter than 300 lines
- Do NOT use .mdx extension

  <done>
Chapter 7 is a complete, build-passing chapter of 300+ lines that presents a phased implementation roadmap with MVP checkpoints, infrastructure costs, risk assessment (NIST AI RMF), and success metrics. A technical lead or project manager can evaluate feasibility, understand costs, assess risks, and define success criteria. The roadmap builds on existing work rather than starting from zero.
