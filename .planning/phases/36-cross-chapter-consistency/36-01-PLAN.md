<objective>
Fix all cross-chapter consistency issues identified by research: 4 model name/size corrections (CONS-01), 4 stale Chapter 7 cross-references, 1 status terminology fix, and 1 landing page description update. Verify CONS-02, CONS-03 remain consistent (no changes needed). Document CONS-04 low-risk position (code blocks unmodified in v1.7). Run build gate.

Purpose: A reader moving between any two chapters encounters no contradictions in model names, tool status, data counts, or chapter descriptions. This is the final phase of v1.7.
Output: 6 files updated with 10 text fixes, clean build confirmed.

Apply exactly 10 text fixes. Change ONLY the specific text identified -- do NOT rewrite surrounding sentences, restructure paragraphs, or "improve" prose. Each fix is a minimal text replacement.

**CONS-01 fixes (model name/size) -- 4 fixes:**

1. `docs/02-strategic-architecture/index.md` line 98: Change "Qwen2.5-Coder-7B" to "Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Base" in the sentence "the current recommendation is [Qwen2.5-Coder-7B](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-coder-family/)". Keep the URL unchanged. The surrounding text about "practical size for self-hosting" remains valid for 14B (fits in 16GB RAM as Q4_K_M).

2. `docs/02-strategic-architecture/index.md` line 184: Change "Qwen2.5-Coder-7B via Ollama" to "Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Base via Ollama" in the generate_bbj_code tool description.

3. `docs/01-bbj-challenge/index.mdx` line 274: Change the Decision callout status from "Training data structure defined; base model evaluation underway." to "Training data structure defined (9,922 ChatML examples in bbjllm); Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Base recommended as next model. See [Fine-Tuning](/docs/fine-tuning)." -- This reflects that base model evaluation is complete (Phase 33 decided 14B-Base).

4. `docs/05-documentation-chat/index.md` line 173: Change "For the 7B model with a 4096-token context" to "For the 14B model with a larger context window" -- the 14B model supports longer context than 4096; keep the description general since the exact deployed context window depends on quantization and configuration.

**Status terminology fix -- 1 fix:**

5. `docs/01-bbj-challenge/index.mdx` line 320: Change "**Under investigation:** Copilot BYOK integration remains in early exploration; [Continue.dev](https://www.continue.dev/) is being evaluated as the primary IDE integration path." to "**Active research:** Copilot BYOK integration remains in early exploration; [Continue.dev](https://www.continue.dev/) is being evaluated as the primary IDE integration path." -- This aligns with Phase 32's established status terminology and matches Chapter 4's treatment of the same topic.

**Stale Chapter 7 cross-references -- 4 fixes:**

For all four, replace the stale description with text that matches Chapter 7's actual content (progress summary and forward plan). Do NOT change the URL path (`/docs/implementation-roadmap`) -- only the descriptive text.

6. `docs/02-strategic-architecture/index.md` line 388: Change "the [implementation roadmap](/docs/implementation-roadmap) with timelines and resource planning" to "the [implementation roadmap](/docs/implementation-roadmap) covering progress to date and the forward plan".

7. `docs/04-ide-integration/index.md` line 673: Change "timelines, milestones, and the path from Continue.dev model delivery to full language-server-powered AI completion" to "progress to date and the forward plan for all components".

8. `docs/05-documentation-chat/index.md` line 308: Change "Timeline, phasing, and resource allocation for all components." to "Progress to date and forward plan for all components."

9. `docs/06-rag-database/index.md` line 537: Change "Timeline and phases for building the ingestion pipeline, provisioning the vector store, and validating retrieval quality." to "Progress to date and forward plan for all components, including the RAG pipeline."

**Landing page fix -- 1 fix:**

10. `src/pages/index.tsx` line 44: Change `'Phased delivery, resources, risks, and success metrics.'` to `'Progress summary and forward plan for the BBj AI strategy.'`

**After all fixes, run verification greps to confirm:**
- No remaining "7B" model references outside historical bbjllm context (Ch3 lines discussing bbjllm's choice of 32B-Instruct are expected)
- No remaining "Under investigation" status terminology
- No remaining "timeline" or "resource planning" or "resource allocation" in Ch7 cross-references
  </action>
  <verify>
Run these grep checks (all should return zero matches or only expected matches):

```bash
# CONS-01: No stale 7B recommendations (Ch3 bbjllm historical references are OK)
grep -n "Qwen2.5-Coder-7B" docs/01-bbj-challenge/index.mdx docs/02-strategic-architecture/index.md docs/04-ide-integration/index.md docs/05-documentation-chat/index.md docs/06-rag-database/index.md

# CONS-01: 14B-Base appears in Ch1, Ch2, Ch5 after fixes
grep -n "14B" docs/01-bbj-challenge/index.mdx docs/02-strategic-architecture/index.md docs/05-documentation-chat/index.md

# Status terminology: no "Under investigation" anywhere
grep -n "Under investigation" docs/*/index.md docs/*/index.mdx

# Cross-refs: no stale Ch7 descriptions
grep -n "timelines and resource planning\|resource allocation for all\|Timeline and phases for building" docs/*/index.md docs/*/index.mdx

# Landing page updated
grep -n "Phased delivery" src/pages/index.tsx
```

All five grep commands should return empty (no matches).
  </verify>
  <done>10 text fixes applied. No stale "7B" model references remain outside historical context. Status terminology uses Phase 32 conventions. All Chapter 7 cross-references describe actual Ch7 content. Landing page description matches Ch7.</done>

**CONS-02 verification (MCP tools):** Run grep to confirm all MCP tool references are consistent. Expected: search_bbj_knowledge (operational), validate_bbj_syntax (operational), generate_bbj_code (planned). Research confirmed these are already consistent -- this is a regression check after Task 1 edits.

```bash
grep -n "search_bbj_knowledge\|generate_bbj_code\|validate_bbj_syntax" docs/*/index.md docs/*/index.mdx
```

Review output to confirm tool names are spelled correctly and status is consistent.

**CONS-03 verification (training data counts):** Run grep to confirm training data counts are consistent. Expected: 9,922 ChatML examples, 2 seed examples. Research confirmed already consistent -- regression check.

```bash
grep -n "9,922\|9922\|seed example" docs/*/index.md docs/*/index.mdx
```

Review output to confirm counts are identical everywhere.

**CONS-04 documentation (BBj code compilation):** bbjcpl is NOT available on this machine. All 21 BBj code blocks across chapters were NOT modified during v1.7 phases (Phases 32-35 only changed prose, not code blocks). Document this in the SUMMARY as an accepted low-risk position. Do NOT claim code blocks were validated -- they were not. The code blocks were validated in earlier phases when they were created/modified.

**Build gate:** Run `npm run build` from the project root. The build must complete with zero content warnings. The only acceptable output noise is the Rspack deprecation notice (from Docusaurus internals, not from our content).

```bash
npm run build 2>&1 | grep -i -E "warn|error|broken"
```

Expected: no output (or only Rspack deprecation notice).

If the build fails, diagnose whether it is a broken link (URL change in cross-reference fix) or content error, and fix immediately.
  </action>
  <verify>
```bash
# Full build must succeed
npm run build

# Verify zero content warnings
npm run build 2>&1 | grep -i -E "warn|error|broken" | grep -v -i "rspack\|deprecat"
```

The filtered output should be empty (no warnings/errors besides Rspack deprecation).
  </verify>
  <done>CONS-02 (MCP tools) verified consistent. CONS-03 (training data counts) verified consistent. CONS-04 documented as accepted low-risk (code blocks unmodified in v1.7, bbjcpl not available). Site builds cleanly with zero content warnings.</done>

After both tasks complete:

1. **CONS-01 (Model names):** grep for "Qwen2.5-Coder-7B" returns zero matches outside Ch3 historical bbjllm references
2. **CONS-02 (MCP tools):** grep confirms consistent tool names and status across all chapters
3. **CONS-03 (Training data):** grep confirms 9,922 and 2 seed counts are consistent
4. **CONS-04 (Code compilation):** Documented as low-risk -- 21 code blocks unmodified in v1.7
5. **Build gate:** `npm run build` completes with zero content warnings
6. **Cross-references:** All Chapter 7 descriptions match actual Ch7 content
7. **Status terminology:** No outliers from Phase 32 conventions

<success_criteria>
- All 10 text fixes applied with minimal diffs (no surrounding prose changes)
- Zero grep matches for stale model names, status terms, or Ch7 descriptions
- CONS-02 and CONS-03 confirmed consistent (regression check passed)
