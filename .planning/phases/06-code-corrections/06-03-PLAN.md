<objective>
Add a reference/attribution to the GuideToGuiProgrammingInBBj.pdf in Chapter 1 so readers can find the authoritative source for BBj GUI patterns.

Purpose: The code corrections in Plan 01 are based on patterns from this PDF. Readers should be able to access the authoritative reference themselves, especially developers who need to verify syntax or learn more about BBj GUI programming across generations.

Output: A reference to the PDF added naturally to Chapter 1, either as an info callout in the "Four Generations" section or as a reference in the chapter's closing section.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add PDF reference attribution to Chapter 1</name>
  <files>docs/01-bbj-challenge/index.mdx</files>
  <action>
Add a reference to the "Guide to GUI Programming in BBj" PDF in Chapter 1. Place it as a Docusaurus `:::info` callout after the "Four Generations of BBj" section introduction (after line 28, before the Mermaid diagram) or at the end of the "Four Generations" section (after the DWC subsection, before "Cross-Generation Code Comparison"). Choose the placement that reads most naturally.

The callout should say something like:

```markdown
:::info[Reference: GUI Programming in BBj]
The code examples in this chapter are based on the *Guide to GUI Programming in BBj* by BASIS International, which documents the complete evolution of BBj GUI APIs from character mnemonics through the modern BBjAPI object model. The guide is available at [documentation.basis.cloud](https://documentation.basis.cloud/BASISHelp/WebHelp/bbjdevguides/BBjGUI/BBjGuiProgramming.htm).
:::
```

Note: The URL `https://documentation.basis.cloud/BASISHelp/WebHelp/bbjdevguides/BBjGUI/BBjGuiProgramming.htm` is the likely canonical location based on the domain referenced in the requirements (`documentation.basis.cloud`). If this exact URL is uncertain, use a more general reference: `Available from [BASIS International documentation](https://documentation.basis.cloud/)`.

IMPORTANT:
- Keep it concise -- 2-3 sentences max
- Do NOT add references to every chapter -- just Chapter 1 where the four-generation code comparison lives
- Make sure the callout renders correctly in MDX (Docusaurus `:::info` admonition syntax)

1. `grep -n "GuideToGuiProgrammingInBBj\|Guide to GUI Programming" docs/01-bbj-challenge/index.mdx` returns a match
2. `grep -n "documentation.basis.cloud" docs/01-bbj-challenge/index.mdx` returns a match
3. `npm run build` succeeds without errors
4. The callout is placed in a logical location within the "Four Generations" section
  </verify>
  <done>
Chapter 1 contains a clearly visible reference to the authoritative BBj GUI programming guide from BASIS International, with a link to documentation.basis.cloud. The site builds successfully.
