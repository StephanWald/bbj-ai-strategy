<objective>
Restructure Chapter 7 (Implementation Roadmap) from a 311-line speculative 4-phase plan into a concise ~120-140 line progress-and-plan chapter. Delete the speculative content (phases, costs, risks, metrics, baselines), update the comparison table with accurate data, add a component summary organized by status, and add a forward plan as a simple bulleted list.

Purpose: Chapter 7 currently presents as if the project is starting Phase 1 of a speculative roadmap. In reality, 7 milestones have been delivered (v1.0-v1.6), and the chapter needs to reflect this reality -- what exists, what's next.

Output: Rewritten `docs/07-implementation-roadmap/index.md` that passes `npm run build` cleanly.

  <name>Task 1: Rewrite Chapter 7 with progress-and-plan structure</name>
  <files>docs/07-implementation-roadmap/index.md</files>
  <action>
Replace the entire content of `docs/07-implementation-roadmap/index.md` with a restructured chapter. Use the research document's "Chapter Structure: Recommended Final Layout" as the template and its "Accurate Data" sections as the authoritative data source.

**YAML front matter:** Update description to reflect the new chapter purpose (progress summary + forward plan, not phased implementation plan).

**TL;DR block:** Rewrite to emphasize delivered work and forward direction. Key points: 7 milestones delivered, name the operational components (language server, RAG system, MCP server, web chat, documentation site), mention fine-tuning research direction (14B-Base, bbjcpl evaluation), state the chapter covers what exists and what comes next. Keep to 3-4 sentences.

**Intro paragraph:** 2-3 sentences repositioning the chapter. The previous chapters describe the technical blueprints; this chapter answers where things stand and what comes next. Do NOT mention "when, how much, what could go wrong" (that was the old chapter's framing).

**"Where We Stand" section:** Keep the comparison table structure (Paper Status Jan 2025 vs Actual Feb 2026). Replace ALL cell data using the verified data from the research document's "Updated Comparison Table Data" section. This is a full table replacement, not an edit -- rebuild from the research data. The table should have 9 rows: Training data, Base model, Language server, IDE integration, RAG database, Documentation chat, MCP server, Compiler validation, Documentation site.

**"What We Built" section:** Component summary organized by status tier (operational first, then operational for internal exploration, then active research). Use 1-3 sentences per component with a cross-reference link to the relevant chapter. Components and their statuses:
- **Operational:** Language server (v0.5.0, 508 commits, 13 contributors, VS Code Marketplace), Documentation site (Docusaurus 3.9.2, 7 chapters), Compiler validation (bbjcpltool v1, integrated into MCP + chat)
- **Operational for internal exploration:** RAG knowledge system (7 parsers, 51K+ chunks, hybrid retrieval, REST API), MCP server (2 tools: search_bbj_knowledge + validate_bbj_syntax, stdio + Streamable HTTP), Web chat (/chat endpoint, Claude API + RAG, SSE streaming, source citations, auto BBj validation)
- **Active research:** Fine-tuning (Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Base recommended, bbjcpl-based compile@1 evaluation, two-stage training approach)

**"What Comes Next" section:** Simple bulleted list of credible next steps. Group loosely by area. No phases, no timelines, no cost estimates. Draw from the research document's "Accurate Data for Forward Plan" section. Include:
- Fine-tuning area: evaluation suite (compile@1), training fixes (validation set, completion masking, Base model switch), dataset cleanup, two-stage training, GGUF export + Ollama deployment
- IDE integration area: FIM fine-tuning, Continue.dev integration, ghost text via InlineCompletionItemProvider, generation detection, semantic context API
- Infrastructure area: generate_bbj_code MCP tool (requires fine-tuned model)
Keep each bullet to 1-2 sentences max. No sub-lists.

**Status block:** Standard `:::note[Where Things Stand]` block with Phase 32 status terminology. Bullet format with bold status labels. Cover: language server, documentation site, compiler validation (operational); RAG system, MCP server, web chat (operational for internal exploration); fine-tuning (active research); FIM training + ghost text + generate_bbj_code tool (planned).

**Closing:** Brief 2-3 sentence paragraph connecting this chapter to the rest of the strategy. Note that the preceding chapters contain the technical detail behind each component. Keep it tight -- do NOT reproduce the full 13-line cross-references section from the old chapter.

**CUTS (do NOT include any of these):**
- The 4-phase implementation plan (Phases 1-4 with MVPs, deliverables, success criteria)
- Mermaid diagram
- Infrastructure costs table and cost-by-scenario table
- "Decision: Acknowledging Existing Work" callout
- "Decision: Hardware Costs Only" callout
- NIST risk assessment framework and risk matrix
- Success metrics tables (technical, user, business)
- "Establishing Baselines" section
- "Why This Order" section
- References to "MVP checkpoint", "Phase 1-4", "stopping points"

**Prohibited terminology (do NOT use):**
- "shipped" (use "operational" or "available")
- "production" (use "operational for internal exploration" or remove)
- "deployed" as final state (use "operational for internal exploration")
- "production-grade", "production corpus"

Run the following checks:
1. `npm run build` in the project root -- must complete with zero errors
2. Count lines: `wc -l docs/07-implementation-roadmap/index.md` -- should be 120-160 lines
3. Grep for prohibited terms: `grep -in "shipped\|production\|MVP\|Phase 1\|Phase 2\|Phase 3\|Phase 4\|checkpoint\|NIST\|risk assessment\|success metrics\|establishing baselines\|infrastructure costs" docs/07-implementation-roadmap/index.md` -- should return zero matches (or only intentional uses like "VS Code Marketplace")
4. Grep for required sections: `grep -n "## Where We Stand\|## What We Built\|## What Comes Next\|Where Things Stand" docs/07-implementation-roadmap/index.md` -- should find all 4
5. Verify comparison table exists: `grep -c "Paper Status" docs/07-implementation-roadmap/index.md` -- should return 1
  </verify>
  <done>
Chapter 7 is a concise progress-and-plan chapter between 120-160 lines. The comparison table has accurate data, the component summary is organized by status, the forward plan is a simple bulleted list, and the site builds cleanly. No remnants of the old speculative content remain.

After the rewrite, perform a thorough verification pass:

1. **Remnant terminology scan:** Grep the file for these terms and verify zero false positives:
   - "Phase 1", "Phase 2", "Phase 3", "Phase 4" (should not appear)
   - "MVP", "checkpoint" (should not appear)
   - "shipped" (should not appear -- use "operational")
   - "production" (should not appear unless in a completely different context)
   - "NIST", "risk", "cost", "budget", "$" (should not appear)
   - "success metric", "baseline" (should not appear)
   - "greenfield" (should not appear)

2. **Status terminology consistency:** Verify Phase 32 conventions are used throughout:
   - "operational" for mature components
   - "operational for internal exploration" for running-but-not-public components
   - "active research" for fine-tuning
   - "planned" for future items
   - No dates in the status block

3. **Cross-reference link check:** Verify all chapter links are valid paths:
   - `/docs/bbj-challenge`
   - `/docs/strategic-architecture`
   - `/docs/fine-tuning`
   - `/docs/ide-integration`
   - `/docs/documentation-chat`
   - `/docs/rag-database`

4. **Data accuracy spot-check:** Verify these specific data points appear correctly:
   - "14B-Base" (not "7B-Base" or "7B")
   - "51K+" or "51,134" for RAG chunks
   - "508 commits" for language server
   - "13 contributors" for language server
   - "9,922" for ChatML examples
   - "2 tools" or "2 operational tools" for MCP server
   - "search_bbj_knowledge" and "validate_bbj_syntax" tool names
   - "compile@1" for evaluation metric

5. **Build verification:** Run `npm run build` and confirm zero errors and zero warnings.

6. **Line count verification:** Confirm the file is between 120-160 lines. If over 160, identify and trim the longest sections.

Fix any issues found during this pass.

  <verify>
1. All grep checks from the remnant scan return zero matches for prohibited terms
