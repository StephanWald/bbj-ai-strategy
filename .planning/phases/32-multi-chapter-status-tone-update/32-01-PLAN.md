<objective>
Update status blocks and tone across Chapters 1 (The BBj Challenge) and 2 (Strategic Architecture) to reflect the February 2026 project state.

Purpose: Chapters 1 and 2 currently describe a January 2025 state -- systems marked "shipped" that should say "operational", systems marked "planned" that are now operational, and incorrect version/count references. This plan corrects all status information and prohibited terminology in these two chapters.

Output: Two updated chapter files with accurate status blocks, corrected decision callout Status fields, and no prohibited terminology ("shipped", "production", "deployed").

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update Chapter 1 status block and tone</name>
  <files>docs/01-bbj-challenge/index.mdx</files>
  <action>
Read docs/01-bbj-challenge/index.mdx fully. This is an MDX file with React component imports -- do NOT modify any JSX elements or imports.

**1. Rewrite the `## Current Status` block (near line 312-321).**

Replace the entire content inside `:::note[Where Things Stand]` with the following items (adapt phrasing naturally but preserve all facts):

- **Operational:** The bbj-language-server (v0.5.0) brings Langium-powered IDE features to BBj developers via the VS Code Marketplace -- syntax highlighting, code completion, and diagnostics.
- **Operational for internal exploration:** A RAG-based knowledge system with 51K+ documentation chunks, a REST API, an MCP server (search_bbj_knowledge and validate_bbj_syntax tools), and a web chat interface powered by Claude API with SSE streaming and source citations.
- **Operational:** Compiler validation via bbjcpltool integrates with both the MCP server and web chat, providing automatic BBj syntax checking.
- **Active research:** Fine-tuning a BBj-specialized code model -- the bbjllm experiment has 9,922 training examples on Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct; research recommends moving to a 14B-Base model with a two-stage training approach.
- **Under investigation:** Copilot BYOK integration remains in early exploration; Continue.dev is being evaluated as the primary IDE integration path.

**2. Search the ENTIRE file for prohibited terms.**

Search for every instance of: "shipped", "production", "deployed", "production-grade", "production corpus". Replace each according to the terminology rules:
- "shipped" -> "operational" or "available"
- "production" -> remove or replace with "operational for internal exploration"
- "deployed" (as final state) -> "operational for internal exploration"

Note: Some prohibited terms may appear in the body text (not just the status block). Check the TL;DR, any inline references, and paragraph text.

**3. CRITICAL: Do NOT modify any JSX/React elements, imports, or Tabs/TabItem components.**

Only edit Markdown content. If in doubt about MDX syntax, leave a section untouched rather than risk breaking the build.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `cd /Users/beff/_workspace/bbj-ai-strategy && npm run build 2>&1 | tail -20`
Build must complete without errors (especially no MDX/JSX errors).
Also verify: `grep -in "shipped\|production" docs/01-bbj-challenge/index.mdx` returns zero matches (or only matches in clearly appropriate contexts like quoting external tools).
  </verify>
  <done>
Chapter 1 status block describes the February 2026 state. No instance of "shipped", "production", or "deployed" appears as a descriptor of project components. MDX file builds cleanly.
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update Chapter 2 status block, table, decision callouts, and tone</name>
  <files>docs/02-strategic-architecture/index.md</files>
  <action>
Read docs/02-strategic-architecture/index.md fully.

**1. Rewrite the `## Current Status` / `:::note[Where Things Stand]` block (near line 364-374).**

Replace the entire content inside the status admonition with items reflecting actual state:

- **Operational:** bbj-language-server (v0.5.0) -- Langium-powered VS Code extension with syntax highlighting, completion, and diagnostics.
- **Operational for internal exploration:** RAG knowledge system -- 51K+ documentation chunks across 7 source groups, PostgreSQL + pgvector database, REST API (search, stats, health endpoints), hybrid retrieval with source-balanced ranking.
- **Operational for internal exploration:** MCP server with two tools -- search_bbj_knowledge (semantic search across documentation corpus) and validate_bbj_syntax (BBj compiler validation via bbjcpl). Available via stdio and Streamable HTTP transports.
- **Operational for internal exploration:** Web chat at /chat endpoint -- Claude API backend with RAG retrieval, SSE streaming, source citations with clickable links, automatic BBj code validation in responses.
- **Operational:** Compiler validation (bbjcpltool) -- integrated into MCP server and web chat with automatic syntax checking and 3-attempt auto-fix.
- **Active research:** Fine-tuned BBj code model -- bbjllm experiment (9,922 ChatML examples on Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct via QLoRA/PEFT); research recommends 14B-Base with two-stage training.
- **Planned:** generate_bbj_code MCP tool -- requires operational fine-tuned model.

**2. Rewrite the status summary table (near line 376-385).**

The table currently uses "Shipped", "In Progress", "Planned" columns. Rewrite the table to reflect actual state using the correct terminology. Use columns: Component | Status | Notes. Each row should match the facts from the research inventory. Key rows:

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| bbj-language-server | Operational | v0.5.0 on VS Code Marketplace |
| RAG ingestion pipeline | Operational for internal exploration | 7 parsers, 51K+ chunks |
| REST retrieval API | Operational for internal exploration | POST /search, GET /stats, GET /health |
| MCP server | Operational for internal exploration | search_bbj_knowledge, validate_bbj_syntax |
| Web chat | Operational for internal exploration | Claude API + RAG + SSE streaming |
| Compiler validation | Operational | bbjcpltool, MCP tool, chat integration |
| Fine-tuned BBj model | Active research | bbjllm experiment; 14B-Base recommended |
| generate_bbj_code | Planned | Requires fine-tuned model |
| Training data repository | Operational | 2 seed examples, 7 topic directories |

**3. Update ALL decision callout `**Status:**` fields.**

Search for every `:::info[Decision:` block. Read the `**Status:**` line in each. Update to reflect current state:
- If Status says "Architecture defined. Model fine-tuning and RAG pipeline are in progress." -> update to reflect RAG is operational, fine-tuning is active research
- If Status says "Architecture defined. Three tool schemas specified." -> update to reflect 2 tools operational (search_bbj_knowledge, validate_bbj_syntax), 1 planned (generate_bbj_code)
- Any Status referencing "shipped" -> change to "operational"
- Any Status referencing "planned" for now-operational things -> change to "operational"

**4. Full-text tone pass.**

Search the entire file for: "shipped", "production", "deployed", "production-grade", "production corpus". Replace each instance:
- "shipped" -> "operational" or "available"
- "production" -> remove or replace contextually
- "production corpus" -> "full documentation corpus"
- "deployed" (as final state) -> "operational for internal exploration"
- Also search for "in progress" and "planned" applied to now-operational components -- update to "operational"

**5. Check TL;DR block at the top of the file.**

If the TL;DR references outdated status (e.g., "planned MCP server", "planned documentation chat"), update to reflect operational state.

**6. Do NOT change architectural descriptions or diagrams.** Only update status-related text and terminology.

  <verify>
Run: `cd /Users/beff/_workspace/bbj-ai-strategy && npm run build 2>&1 | tail -20`
Build must complete without errors.
Also verify: `grep -in "shipped" docs/02-strategic-architecture/index.md` returns zero matches.
Also verify: `grep -in '"production"' docs/02-strategic-architecture/index.md` returns zero matches (or only in clearly appropriate quoted contexts).
  </verify>
  <done>
Chapter 2 status block describes February 2026 state. Status table uses correct terminology. All decision callout Status fields updated. No prohibited terms remain. Build passes cleanly.

After both tasks complete:
1. `npm run build` passes with zero errors in the docs/ directory
2. `grep -rn "shipped" docs/01-bbj-challenge/index.mdx docs/02-strategic-architecture/index.md` returns zero matches
3. `grep -rn "production" docs/01-bbj-challenge/index.mdx docs/02-strategic-architecture/index.md` returns zero matches (except if "production" appears in a legitimately different context like describing a software concept)
4. Both chapters' status blocks mention "operational for internal exploration" for running systems
5. Chapter 2 status table has correct Component/Status/Notes structure
