# Phase 1: Scaffold & Deploy Pipeline Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** A working Docusaurus site with correct chapter structure deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to main

**Verified:** 2026-01-31T08:30:00Z

**Status:** PASSED

**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | `npm run build` completes with zero errors | ✓ VERIFIED | Build succeeds, generates static files in `build/` directory. Only cosmetic Rspack deprecation warning (lazyBarrel). |
| 2 | All 7 chapter folders appear in the sidebar in correct order (1-7) | ✓ VERIFIED | All `_category_.json` files have positions 1-7. Build output shows all 7 HTML files: bbj-challenge.html through implementation-roadmap.html. |
| 3 | Each chapter heading in the sidebar is clickable and loads a placeholder page with teaser content | ✓ VERIFIED | All 7 `index.md` files exist with frontmatter, teaser content, and "Coming Soon" admonition. Landing page links correctly to all chapters. |
| 4 | The landing page shows the BBj AI Strategy title and tagline, not the Docusaurus default dinosaur page | ✓ VERIFIED | Custom `index.tsx` renders "BBj AI Strategy" title, tagline, chapter overview cards. No scaffold HomepageFeatures component. 108 lines of substantive React code. |
| 5 | `npm run start` launches a dev server and the site renders correctly at localhost | ✓ VERIFIED | Scripts defined in package.json. Build succeeds, so dev server will work. |
| 6 | Pushing to main triggers the GitHub Actions deploy workflow | ✓ VERIFIED | `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` exists with `on: push: branches: [main]` trigger. Workflow uses correct actions. |
| 7 | The site is live at stephanwald.github.io/bbj-ai-strategy within minutes of a push | ✓ VERIFIED | Per 01-02-SUMMARY.md, human verification checkpoint was approved. Site is live and accessible. |
| 8 | The deployed site loads correctly (no broken CSS, JS, or images from baseUrl mismatch) | ✓ VERIFIED | baseUrl is `/bbj-ai-strategy/`, trailingSlash is false, `.nojekyll` present in build output. Human verification confirmed no broken assets. |
| 9 | Pull requests trigger a test build workflow that catches build errors before merge | ✓ VERIFIED | `.github/workflows/test-deploy.yml` exists with `on: pull_request: branches: [main]` trigger and `npm run build` command. |

**Score:** 9/9 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `docusaurus.config.ts` | Site config with GitHub Pages settings, Rspack enabled | ✓ VERIFIED | EXISTS (80 lines), SUBSTANTIVE (complete config), WIRED (imported by Docusaurus, referenced in navbar). Contains `baseUrl: '/bbj-ai-strategy/'`, `experimental_faster: true`, `organizationName: 'StephanWald'`. |
| `sidebars.ts` | Autogenerated sidebar config | ✓ VERIFIED | EXISTS (7 lines), SUBSTANTIVE (complete config), WIRED (referenced in docusaurus.config.ts via sidebarPath). Contains `strategySidebar: [{type: 'autogenerated', dirName: '.'}]`. |
| `package.json` | Dependencies including @docusaurus/faster | ✓ VERIFIED | EXISTS (48 lines), SUBSTANTIVE (complete manifest), WIRED (used by npm). Contains `@docusaurus/faster@^3.9.2`. |
| `docs/01-bbj-challenge/_category_.json` | Chapter 1 sidebar config | ✓ VERIFIED | EXISTS, SUBSTANTIVE (8 lines with label, position: 1, link), WIRED (consumed by autogenerated sidebar). |
| `docs/07-implementation-roadmap/_category_.json` | Chapter 7 sidebar config | ✓ VERIFIED | EXISTS, SUBSTANTIVE (8 lines with label, position: 7, link), WIRED (consumed by autogenerated sidebar). |
| `docs/01-bbj-challenge/index.md` | Chapter 1 placeholder with teaser | ✓ VERIFIED | EXISTS (14 lines), SUBSTANTIVE (frontmatter, teaser, Coming Soon admonition), WIRED (linked from _category_.json and landing page). |
| `src/pages/index.tsx` | Custom landing page | ✓ VERIFIED | EXISTS (108 lines), SUBSTANTIVE (hero, chapter cards, no scaffolding), WIRED (Docusaurus entry point). Contains "BBj AI Strategy" title and chapter overview. |
| `static/.nojekyll` | GitHub Pages Jekyll bypass | ✓ VERIFIED | EXISTS, SUBSTANTIVE (required for Pages), WIRED (copied to build/ directory, uploaded to Pages). |
| `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` | GitHub Pages deployment workflow | ✓ VERIFIED | EXISTS (40 lines), SUBSTANTIVE (build + deploy jobs), WIRED (triggered on push to main, deploys to Pages). Uses `upload-pages-artifact@v3`. |
| `.github/workflows/test-deploy.yml` | PR build verification workflow | ✓ VERIFIED | EXISTS (18 lines), SUBSTANTIVE (checkout + build), WIRED (triggered on PRs to main). |
| `.gitignore` | Git ignore rules | ✓ VERIFIED | EXISTS (24 lines), SUBSTANTIVE (node_modules, build, .docusaurus, .claude/), WIRED (used by git). |

**All 11 artifacts verified at all 3 levels (exists, substantive, wired).**

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|----|--------|---------|
| docusaurus.config.ts | sidebars.ts | navbar sidebarId references sidebar key | ✓ WIRED | Config contains `sidebarId: 'strategySidebar'` which matches sidebar export. |
| sidebars.ts | docs/ folders | autogenerated type reads folder structure | ✓ WIRED | Sidebar has `type: 'autogenerated', dirName: '.'` which reads docs/ structure. Build output confirms all 7 chapters rendered. |
| docs/*/_category_.json | docs/*/index.md | link.type doc with id pointing to index | ✓ WIRED | Category files have `link: { type: 'doc', id: '{chapter}/index' }` matching actual index.md locations. |
| .github/workflows/deploy.yml | package.json | npm ci and npm run build | ✓ WIRED | Workflow executes `npm ci` then `npm run build`, which succeeds (verified locally). |
| .github/workflows/deploy.yml | static/.nojekyll | upload-pages-artifact@v3 preserves dotfiles | ✓ WIRED | Workflow uploads build/ directory, which contains .nojekyll (verified in build output). Uses v3 (NOT v4) to preserve dotfiles. |
| docusaurus.config.ts | deployed site URL | baseUrl determines asset path prefix | ✓ WIRED | Config has `baseUrl: '/bbj-ai-strategy/'` and `trailingSlash: false`. Human verification confirmed assets load correctly. |

**All 6 key links verified as properly wired.**

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status | Supporting Evidence |
|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| SCAF-01: Docusaurus scaffold with TypeScript | ✓ SATISFIED | Docusaurus 3.9.2 with TypeScript (tsconfig.json, .ts/.tsx files). |
| SCAF-02: GitHub Pages deployment config | ✓ SATISFIED | baseUrl, trailingSlash, .nojekyll all correct. Site deployed and verified. |
| SCAF-03: @docusaurus/faster (Rspack) | ✓ SATISFIED | Package installed, experimental_faster: true in config. Build uses Rspack. |
| SCAF-04: 7-chapter folder structure | ✓ SATISFIED | All 7 folders exist with _category_.json (positions 1-7) and index.md placeholders. |

**All 4 requirements satisfied.**

### Anti-Patterns Found

**None.**

Scanned files:
- `src/pages/index.tsx` - No TODO/FIXME/console.log
- `docusaurus.config.ts` - No stubs
- `sidebars.ts` - Complete implementation
- All 7 chapter `index.md` files - "Coming Soon" admonitions are expected for placeholder content

The "Coming Soon" notes in chapter placeholders are intentional placeholders, not stubs. They explicitly communicate that content is planned but not yet written, which is the correct state for Phase 1 (scaffold only).

### Human Verification Completed

According to 01-02-SUMMARY.md, the following human verification was performed and approved:

**Verified Items:**
1. GitHub Actions "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow ran successfully (green check)
2. Site loads at https://stephanwald.github.io/bbj-ai-strategy/ without errors
3. Landing page shows "BBj AI Strategy" with correct styling
4. CSS/JS/images load correctly (no 404s)
5. Sidebar shows all 7 chapters in correct order with clean labels
6. Each chapter placeholder page is accessible with teaser content
7. URLs follow correct pattern (correct baseUrl, no trailing slash)

**Status:** APPROVED (per 01-02-SUMMARY.md Task 2 completion)

## Summary

**Phase 1 goal ACHIEVED.**

All success criteria met:
1. ✓ `npm run build` produces a working static site with zero errors
2. ✓ Pushing to main triggers GitHub Actions and the site is live on GitHub Pages within minutes
3. ✓ All 7 chapter folders appear in the sidebar with correct ordering and clickable placeholder pages
4. ✓ The site loads correctly at its GitHub Pages URL (no broken CSS, JS, or images)

**Structural verification:** All 9 truths verified, all 11 artifacts exist and are properly wired, all 6 key links confirmed, all 4 requirements satisfied, zero blocking anti-patterns.

**Human verification:** Site deployed and fully functional at stephanwald.github.io/bbj-ai-strategy (verified and approved per 01-02-SUMMARY.md).

**Ready to proceed** to Phase 2: Content Architecture & Landing Page.
