# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 10-flare-parser
    provides: Flare parser implementation and DocumentParser protocol
  - phase: 11-bbj-intelligence
    provides: Generation tagger, doc type classifier, context headers
  - phase: 12-embedding-pipeline
    provides: Embedder, chunker, pipeline orchestrator, bulk storage
  - phase: 13-additional-parsers
    provides: PDF, WordPress, MDX, BBj source parsers
provides:
  - Getting Started sub-page under Chapter 6 bridging design to implementation
  - Pipeline architecture diagram (Mermaid)
  - Source coverage reference table with GitHub parser links
  - Inline data model documentation (Document, Chunk, DocumentParser)
affects: [14-02 README documentation, future docs site updates]

# Tech tracking

key-decisions:
  - "Design-first page structure: why-this-approach before practical details"
  - "Reference link definitions for GitHub URLs (easier bulk updates if repo moves)"
  - "Source coverage as table with URL scheme column for developer reference"
  - "Inline model snippets show key fields only, link to full source on GitHub"

patterns-established:
  - "Sub-page pattern: sidebar_position frontmatter in category directory for autogenerated sidebar"
  - "GitHub URL pattern: blob/main/ for files, tree/main/ for directories (branch-based, no tags)"

# Phase 14 Plan 01: Getting Started Sub-Page Summary

**RAG Getting Started sub-page with Mermaid pipeline diagram, source coverage table, inline data model snippets, and GitHub code links under Chapter 6**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-01T09:04:57Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-01T09:06:40Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files created:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Getting Started page appears as sub-item under RAG Database Design in the Docusaurus sidebar
- Pipeline architecture diagram renders as Mermaid graph LR showing all 6 sources feeding through parse/tag/chunk/embed/store stages
- Source coverage table documents all 6 sources with GitHub links to parser modules and URL scheme patterns
- Inline code snippets for Document, Chunk, and DocumentParser Protocol models with links to full source files
- Cross-references to Chapter 6 for design rationale and README for setup instructions
- Docusaurus build succeeds with the new page

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Write Getting Started sub-page** - `9c430aa` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `docs/06-rag-database/getting-started.md` - RAG Getting Started sub-page with pipeline diagram, source coverage, data models, intelligence overview, and CLI quick reference

## Decisions Made

- **Design-first structure:** "Why This Approach" section before pipeline details, per CONTEXT.md direction
- **Reference link definitions:** Used Markdown reference links for GitHub URLs (5 parser links defined once, referenced in table) for maintainability
- **Inline model snippets:** Showed class signatures and key fields only, not full source -- links to GitHub for complete code
- **All sources styled green in diagram:** Consistent fill color (#e8f4e8) for all source nodes, blue (#e8e8f4) for pgvector store, matching Chapter 6's color scheme

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Getting Started page complete and building successfully
- Ready for plan 02 (README and quality report)
- The Getting Started page already links to the README (which plan 02 will create)
