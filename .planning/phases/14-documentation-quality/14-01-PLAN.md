<objective>
Write the RAG Getting Started sub-page that lives under Chapter 6 in the Docusaurus docs site.

Purpose: Engineers reading Chapter 6's design rationale need a bridge to the actual implementation -- this page provides that bridge by explaining the source-by-source approach, showing the pipeline architecture, and linking directly to code files. It satisfies requirements DOC-02 and DOC-03.

Output: `docs/06-rag-database/getting-started.md` -- a complete Getting Started page with pipeline diagram, source coverage table, data model snippets, and GitHub code links.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write Getting Started sub-page</name>
  <files>docs/06-rag-database/getting-started.md</files>
  <action>
Create `docs/06-rag-database/getting-started.md` with the following structure:

**Frontmatter:**
```yaml
sidebar_position: 1
title: "Getting Started with RAG Ingestion"
description: "Source-by-source ingestion approach, pipeline architecture, and practical code guide"
```

**Page structure (in this order):**

1. **Title & intro** -- "Getting Started with RAG Ingestion". Brief 2-3 sentence intro: this page bridges Chapter 6's design with the actual implementation code. Link to [Chapter 6](./index.md) for design rationale.

2. **Why This Approach section** -- Brief framing (NOT a repeat of Chapter 6):
   - Source-by-source ingestion: each of 5 sources has its own parser because each has unique structure (Flare XHTML vs WordPress HTML vs MDX vs PDF vs BBj source)
   - Generation tagging: every chunk gets labeled with BBj generation(s) so retrieval can filter by what the developer is actually working with
   - Heading-aware chunking: preserves document structure with contextual headers so chunks make sense in isolation
   - Keep this to ~8-12 sentences total. Link to Chapter 6 sections for deeper rationale.

3. **Pipeline Architecture section** -- Mermaid `graph LR` diagram showing:
   - Left subgraph "Sources": Flare XHTML, PDF, WordPress (Advantage), WordPress (KB), MDX, BBj Source
   - Right subgraph "Pipeline": Parse -> Tag (Generation + Doc Type) -> Chunk (heading-aware) -> Embed (Ollama/OpenAI) -> Store (pgvector)
   - Sources all feed into Parse
   - Use Docusaurus mermaid code fence (` ```mermaid `)
   - Style with fill colors consistent with Chapter 6's existing diagrams (green for sources, blue for store)

4. **Source Coverage section** -- Table with columns: Source | Parser Module | Content Type | URL Scheme
   - Flare XHTML | `parsers/flare.py` | API reference, concepts, migration guides | `flare://path`
   - PDF | `parsers/pdf.py` | GUI programming guide | `pdf://filename#section`
   - WordPress/Advantage | `parsers/wordpress.py` | Magazine articles | `https://basis.cloud/advantage...`
   - WordPress/KB | `parsers/wordpress.py` | Knowledge base lessons | `https://basis.cloud/knowledge...`
   - Docusaurus MDX | `parsers/mdx.py` | DWC course tutorials | `mdx://chapter/file`
   - BBj Source | `parsers/bbj_source.py` | Code examples | `file://relative-path`
   - Each parser module name should be a GitHub link: `https://github.com/StephanWald/bbj-ai-strategy/blob/main/rag-ingestion/src/bbj_rag/parsers/{file}`

5. **Key Data Models section** -- Show SHORT inline code snippets (just the class signatures and key fields, NOT the full files) for:
   - `Document` model (source_url, title, doc_type, content, generations, context_header, deprecated, metadata) -- link to full file on GitHub
   - `Chunk` model (same fields + content_hash, embedding) -- link to full file on GitHub
   - `DocumentParser` protocol (the `parse()` method signature) -- link to full file on GitHub
   - Use Python code blocks. After each snippet, add a link: "Full source: [models.py](https://github.com/StephanWald/bbj-ai-strategy/blob/main/rag-ingestion/src/bbj_rag/models.py)"

6. **BBj Intelligence section** -- Brief explanation of what happens between parsing and chunking:
   - Generation tagger: assigns `all`, `character`, `vpro5`, `bbj_gui`, `dwc` labels based on condition tags, file paths, and content patterns
   - Document type classifier: categorizes as api-reference, concept, example, migration, etc. based on content structure
   - Context headers: builds hierarchical headers like "BBj Objects > BBjWindow > addButton > Parameters"
   - Link to intelligence module directory on GitHub: `https://github.com/StephanWald/bbj-ai-strategy/tree/main/rag-ingestion/src/bbj_rag/intelligence`

7. **Running the Pipeline section** -- Brief practical orientation:
   - Point to the `rag-ingestion/README.md` for full setup and CLI usage
   - Show the basic command pattern: `bbj-rag ingest --source <name>` with a note about what sources are available
   - Show the quality report command: `bbj-rag report`
   - Admonition or note box pointing to README for prerequisites (PostgreSQL, Ollama, Python/uv)

**Writing guidelines:**
- Design-first: explain "why this approach" before "how it works" (per CONTEXT.md decision)
- Keep it under 250 lines of markdown -- this is a guide, not a manual
- Do NOT duplicate Chapter 6 design rationale -- link to it
- Use Docusaurus admonitions (:::tip, :::info) sparingly (1-2 max)
- GitHub URLs use `blob/main/` for files, `tree/main/` for directories (branch-based, no tags)
- Base URL: `https://github.com/StephanWald/bbj-ai-strategy`
