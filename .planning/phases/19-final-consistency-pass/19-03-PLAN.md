<objective>
Audit and fix landing page descriptions (chapter cards and initiative cards) and frontmatter `description` fields to ensure they match the updated chapter content. Then run the final Docusaurus build as the absolute gate: zero warnings, zero broken links.

Purpose: Satisfy QUAL-04 (landing page and frontmatter alignment) and QUAL-03 (zero-warning build). This is the last plan in Phase 19 -- the final build proves the site is clean.
Output: Updated `src/pages/index.tsx` and frontmatter fields where needed. Clean build confirmed.

**Part A: Landing page chapter descriptions**

1. Read `src/pages/index.tsx` and find the `chapters` array (contains 7 objects with `title` and `description` fields).
2. For each chapter, read the actual chapter file and compare the landing page description with the chapter's current content.
3. Apply the decision: "Landing page descriptions are aspirational -- only fix outright contradictions with chapter content, not minor drift."
4. Fix only descriptions that contain outright contradictions. Examples of what to fix:
   - Description says "three completion tiers" but chapter now describes two-layer completion
   - Description doesn't mention MCP when the chapter is now MCP-centric
   - Description says "deployment options" but chapter now has single deployment approach
5. Do NOT rewrite descriptions that are merely imprecise or slightly outdated. The threshold is "outright contradiction."

**Part B: Landing page initiative descriptions**

1. In the same `src/pages/index.tsx`, find the `initiatives` array (contains 3 objects describing the three AI initiatives).
2. Compare each initiative description with the current chapter content:
   - Fine-Tuned Model initiative: compare with Chapter 3
   - IDE Extension initiative: compare with Chapter 4
   - Documentation Chat initiative: compare with Chapter 5
3. Fix only outright contradictions. The initiatives should be consistent with MCP framing where relevant.

**Part C: Frontmatter description fields**

1. For each of the 8 doc files, read the frontmatter `description` field (in the YAML block at the top).
2. Compare with the chapter's actual content (especially the TL;DR block and first few paragraphs).
3. Fix any descriptions that are outright contradictions with the current chapter content.
4. For Chapters that changed significantly in v1.3 (Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), pay closer attention to whether the description still captures the chapter's primary message.

**Important constraints:**
- Apply minimal edits -- only fix outright contradictions
- Preserve the tone and style of existing descriptions
- Do NOT add MCP jargon to every description just because v1.3 added MCP content
- Keep descriptions concise (1-2 sentences each)
  </action>
  <verify>
After edits:
1. Read `src/pages/index.tsx` chapters array and confirm no description contradicts its chapter
2. Read `src/pages/index.tsx` initiatives array and confirm consistency with MCP framing
3. For each doc file, verify frontmatter description is not contradicted by TL;DR block
  </verify>
  <done>Landing page chapter descriptions, initiative descriptions, and frontmatter description fields are all consistent with current chapter content. Only outright contradictions were fixed.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Final Docusaurus build gate -- zero warnings</name>
  <files>(no files modified -- build verification only)</files>
  <action>
Run the final Docusaurus build after all Phase 19 edits (Plans 01, 02, and this plan's Task 1):

```bash
cd /Users/beff/_workspace/bbj-ai-strategy && npm run build 2>&1
```

**Success criteria:**
- Exit code 0 (build succeeds)
- Zero broken links (enforced by `onBrokenLinks: 'throw'`)
- Zero content warnings
- The ONLY acceptable non-zero output is the Rspack `Module "node:assert"` deprecation notice (Docusaurus internal, not content-related)

**If build fails or has warnings:**
1. Read the error/warning output carefully
2. Identify the source file and line
3. Fix the issue (broken link, malformed Markdown, etc.)
4. Re-run the build
5. Repeat until clean

**If build passes:** Record the clean build as confirmation that QUAL-03 is satisfied.

This is the absolute final gate for Phase 19. The build must pass before the phase can be marked complete.
  </action>
  <verify>
`npm run build` produces exit code 0 with no content warnings or broken link errors. The only non-content output is the Rspack deprecation notice.
  </verify>
  <done>Docusaurus build completes cleanly. Zero broken links, zero warnings. QUAL-03 satisfied. Phase 19 is complete.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

After both tasks complete:
1. Landing page descriptions match chapter content (no outright contradictions)
2. Frontmatter descriptions match chapter content (no outright contradictions)
3. `npm run build` exits with code 0 and zero content warnings
4. All five QUAL requirements are satisfied across Plans 01-03:
   - QUAL-01: BBj code validation (addressed in Plan 01 via user decision)
   - QUAL-02: Status blocks consistent (fixed in Plan 02)
   - QUAL-03: Zero-warning build (verified in this plan)
   - QUAL-04: Landing page and frontmatter alignment (fixed in this plan)
   - QUAL-05: Decision callout format (verified and fixed in Plan 02)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- QUAL-03 satisfied: Docusaurus build completes with zero broken links and zero warnings
- QUAL-04 satisfied: Landing page and frontmatter descriptions consistent with chapter content
- All Phase 19 work complete -- site is verified clean and consistent
- Phase 19 can be marked complete in the roadmap
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/19-final-consistency-pass/19-03-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
