<objective>
Audit and fix all 7 chapter status blocks and all 17 decision callouts for consistency and format compliance. Remove dates from status block headings (they go stale), reconcile status content against Chapter 7 as the single source of truth, and verify every decision callout has the four required fields with substantive content.

Purpose: Satisfy QUAL-02 (status block consistency) and QUAL-05 (decision callout format). These are content-level fixes that require reading and comparing files -- not machine-checkable.
Output: All 7 chapter doc files updated with consistent status blocks and verified decision callouts.

**Step 1: Read Chapter 7's Current Status block** to establish the source of truth. This block contains the authoritative status for every component.

**Step 2: Read all 7 status blocks.** Each chapter has a `:::note[Where Things Stand ...]` block near the end. Record:
- Current heading (with date)
- Current bullet points
- Any inconsistencies with Chapter 7

Current date formats to find and fix:
- Ch1: `:::note[Where Things Stand -- January 2026]`
- Ch2: `:::note[Where Things Stand -- February 2026]`
- Ch3: `:::note[Where Things Stand -- January 2026]`
- Ch4: `:::note[Where Things Stand -- February 2026]`
- Ch5: `:::note[Where Things Stand -- February 2026]`
- Ch6: `:::note[Where Things Stand -- February 2026]`
- Ch7: `:::note[Where Things Stand -- February 2026]`

**Step 3: For each chapter, apply two edits:**

a) **Remove the date from the heading.** Change from `:::note[Where Things Stand -- <Month Year>]` to `:::note[Where Things Stand]`. This is a mechanical find-and-replace on each file.

b) **Reconcile content with Chapter 7.** Read each bullet point in the chapter's status block and compare with Chapter 7's narrative. Fix any inconsistencies:
  - If a chapter says "not yet built" but Ch7 says it is partially complete or shipped, update the chapter
  - If a chapter says "shipped" but Ch7 says "planned", update the chapter
  - Keep each chapter's natural voice -- just fix factual inconsistencies
  - Do NOT standardize phrasing across chapters; each chapter can describe the same state differently

**Specific reconciliation rules per chapter:**
- **Ch1 (BBj Challenge):** Status should reflect that the challenge is documented and the strategy exists. No component status needed -- Ch1 is about the problem, not the solution.
- **Ch2 (Strategic Architecture):** Should reflect v1.2 RAG pipeline shipped, bbjcpltool validated, MCP architecture defined (not implemented).
- **Ch3 (Fine-Tuning):** Should reflect ~10K data points collected, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B selected, fine-tuning in progress.
- **Ch4 (IDE Integration):** Should reflect bbj-language-server v0.5.0 shipped, bbjcpltool v1 proof-of-concept validated, compiler-in-the-loop integration planned.
- **Ch5 (Documentation Chat):** Should reflect two-path architecture defined (MCP + embedded chat), not yet built. RAG pipeline built (v1.2) but not deployed against production corpus.
- **Ch6 (RAG Database):** Should reflect v1.2 ingestion pipeline built with 6 parsers, not yet deployed to production. MCP search tool planned.
- **Ch7 (Implementation Roadmap):** Should reflect the comprehensive status of all components (this IS the source of truth, so just remove the date).

**Important:** Keep natural voice. Do NOT force all status blocks to use identical wording. Each chapter naturally talks about its own domain.

After edits:
1. Grep all doc files for `:::note\[Where Things Stand` -- verify NONE contain a date (no "January", "February", or year)
2. Read each status block and confirm no factual contradictions with Chapter 7
3. Confirm each file's status block still exists (no accidental deletion)
  </verify>
  <done>All 7 status block headings have dates removed. All status block content is factually consistent with Chapter 7 as the source of truth. Each chapter retains its natural voice.</done>

**Step 1: Find all decision callouts** by searching all doc files for `:::info[Decision:`. The research identified 17 decision callouts across the site (Ch1:1, Ch2:2, Ch3:3, Ch4:4, Ch5:2, Ch6:3, Ch7:2).

**Step 2: For each decision callout, verify FORMAT** -- all four fields must be present with bold labels:
```
:::info[Decision: Title Here]
**Choice:** ...
**Rationale:** ...
**Alternatives considered:** ...
**Status:** ...
:::
```

Check that:
- All four field labels exist (exactly: `**Choice:**`, `**Rationale:**`, `**Alternatives considered:**`, `**Status:**`)
- No extra/missing fields
- The `:::` closing tag exists

**Step 3: For each decision callout, verify CONTENT QUALITY:**
- **Choice** should state what was decided (not just "yes" or "we chose X")
- **Rationale** should explain WHY (not just restate the choice; should reference concrete reasons)
- **Alternatives considered** should list genuine alternatives that were actually evaluated (not strawmen or obvious non-starters)
- **Status** should be one of: Decided, Adopted, Validated, Pending, Superseded (or similar clear status)

**Step 4: Fix any issues found:**
- Missing fields: Add them with substantive content based on the surrounding chapter context
- Shallow rationale: Expand to include the actual reasoning (derive from chapter content)
- Strawman alternatives: Replace with genuine alternatives
- For ambiguous issues (where the "right" content is not clear from context), leave a `<!-- REVIEW: ... -->` HTML comment for user review rather than guessing

Do NOT rewrite decision callouts that are already well-formed. Only fix what's actually broken or missing.
  </action>
  <verify>
After edits:
1. Grep for `:::info\[Decision:` and count -- should find 17 instances
2. For each instance, verify the four bold labels exist within the callout block
3. Spot-check 3-4 callouts to confirm content quality (rationale is substantive, alternatives are genuine)
  </verify>
  <done>All 17 decision callouts have all four required fields (Choice, Rationale, Alternatives considered, Status) with substantive content. No callouts have been unnecessarily rewritten.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After both tasks complete:
1. No status block heading contains a date
2. No status block contradicts Chapter 7's component status narrative
3. All 17 decision callouts have four fields with substantive content
4. No files have been accidentally broken (valid Markdown structure preserved)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- QUAL-02 satisfied: All status blocks updated, consistent with Ch7 source of truth, dates removed
- QUAL-05 satisfied: All decision callouts have Choice, Rationale, Alternatives considered, Status with substantive content
- Natural voice preserved across chapters -- no forced standardization
- Minimal edits -- only fix what is actually inconsistent or missing
</success_criteria>
