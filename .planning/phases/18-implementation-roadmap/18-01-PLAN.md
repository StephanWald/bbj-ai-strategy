  <name>Task 1: Update status table, TL;DR, phase descriptions, and Current Status block</name>
  <files>docs/07-implementation-roadmap/index.md</files>
  <action>
Update four sections of Chapter 7, working top-to-bottom:

**1. TL;DR block (lines 9-11):**
Replace the existing TL;DR content with:
"A four-phase roadmap with explicit MVP checkpoints, building on the already-shipped bbj-language-server, a v1.2 RAG ingestion pipeline (built, awaiting production deployment), in-progress model fine-tuning (~10K of an estimated 50-80K data points), and a defined MCP server architecture that provides a standard protocol for all BBj AI tools. Compiler validation via bbjcpl has been proven at concept level (see Chapter 4), adding ground-truth syntax checking to the hallucination mitigation strategy. Total infrastructure investment is modest -- roughly $1,500-5,000 one-time plus minimal monthly hosting -- because the strategy uses self-hosted open-source tooling throughout. Each phase delivers standalone value; you can stop at any checkpoint and still have a working system."

**2. "Where We Stand" table (lines 20-28):**
Replace the existing 5-row table (including header row) with an 8-row table (header + 7 component rows). Change column header from "Actual Status (Jan 2026)" to "Actual (Feb 2026)". Use these exact rows:

| Component | Paper Status (Jan 2025) | Actual (Feb 2026) |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Training data | Schema defined, no curated examples | ~10K data points collected; estimated 50-80K needed for full generational coverage |
| Base model | Candidates identified (CodeLlama, StarCoder2) | Qwen2.5-Coder-7B selected, fine-tuning in progress |
| Language server | Architecture planned | v0.5.0 shipped, published on VS Code Marketplace |
| Copilot integration | Not mentioned | Early exploration, cautiously optimistic |
| RAG database | Schema designed | Ingestion pipeline built (v1.2) with 6 source parsers; not yet deployed against production corpus |
| Documentation chat | Architecture planned | Two-path architecture defined (MCP access + embedded chat); not yet built |
| MCP server | Not mentioned | Architecture defined, three tool schemas specified; not yet implemented |
| Compiler validation | Not mentioned | Proof-of-concept validated (bbjcpltool v1); production deployment planned |

**3. Phase descriptions -- add MCP bullets to each phase's "Key deliverables" list:**

Phase 1 (Model Validation, ~line 74-79): After the GGUF/Ollama bullet, add:
- **MCP tool schema alignment** -- Ensure the model's input/output formats align with the [`generate_bbj_code`](/docs/strategic-architecture#mcp-server-the-concrete-integration-layer) tool schema defined in the MCP server architecture, so the model can serve as a drop-in backend when the server is built.

Phase 2 (IDE Integration, ~line 99-103): After "Completion quality guardrails" bullet, add:
- **Compiler validation integration** -- Supplement Langium heuristic validation with [bbjcpl ground-truth checking](/docs/ide-integration#compiler-validation) for completions that pass initial parsing. The compiler catches semantic errors (undeclared variables, type mismatches) that the parser cannot detect.
- **MCP-ready context API** -- Design the semantic context extraction service to align with the MCP [`generate_bbj_code`](/docs/strategic-architecture#mcp-server-the-concrete-integration-layer) tool interface, enabling future MCP clients to request completions through the same pipeline.

Phase 3 (RAG + Doc Chat, ~line 122-127): After "Chat interface" bullet, add:
- **MCP search tool backend** -- Implement the RAG retrieval service as the backend for the [`search_bbj_knowledge`](/docs/strategic-architecture#mcp-server-the-concrete-integration-layer) MCP tool, exposing documentation search to any MCP-compatible client (IDE extensions, CLI tools, chat interfaces).

Phase 4 (Refinement, ~line 147-151): After "Production deployment hardening" bullet, add:
- **MCP server deployment** -- Package the MCP server for production use, connecting all three tool backends (code generation, knowledge search, syntax validation) through the [unified protocol](/docs/strategic-architecture#mcp-server-the-concrete-integration-layer) defined in the architecture.

**4. "Current Status" block (lines 279-287):**
Replace the entire :::note block. Change heading from "Where Things Stand -- January 2026" to "Where Things Stand -- February 2026". Update all bullet points:

:::note[Where Things Stand -- February 2026]
- **Phase 1 (Model Validation):** Partially complete. The [bbj-language-server](https://github.com/BBx-Kitchen/bbj-language-server) (v0.5.0) is shipped and published on the VS Code Marketplace. Fine-tuning is in progress with ~10K training data points (estimated 50-80K needed for full generational coverage) using Qwen2.5-Coder-7B as the base model. Evaluation benchmarks are being developed.
- **Phase 2 (IDE Integration):** Planned. The language server provides the foundation; LLM-powered completions and compiler validation have not yet been integrated.
- **Phase 3 (RAG + Doc Chat):** Partially complete. The RAG ingestion pipeline (v1.2) is built with 6 source parsers covering MadCap Flare docs, standalone PDFs, Advantage articles, Knowledge Base, DWC-Course, and BBj source code. The pipeline is not yet deployed against the production corpus. The documentation chat interface has not been built, though a two-path architecture (MCP access + embedded chat) is defined.
- **Phase 4 (Refinement):** Planned. Depends on Phases 1-3 delivering functional systems for real-world testing.
- **MCP architecture:** Defined. Three tool schemas specified ([`search_bbj_knowledge`](/docs/strategic-architecture#mcp-server-the-concrete-integration-layer), `generate_bbj_code`, `validate_bbj_syntax`) with a generate-validate-fix loop. No implementation exists yet.
- **Total infrastructure investment:** Modest. Estimated $2,000-5,000 one-time (primarily the training GPU) plus $50-420/month for hosting if cloud-deployed.

  <name>Task 2: Update risk assessment with compiler validation mitigation and training data reality</name>
  <files>docs/07-implementation-roadmap/index.md</files>
  <action>
Update two rows in the Risk Assessment table (lines 205-212) and one paragraph in the explanatory text:

**1. Hallucination risk row (first row in table):**
Replace the existing Mitigation cell for "Fine-tuned model hallucinates BBj syntax":
OLD: "Langium parser validation of all LLM suggestions before presentation; evaluation benchmarks with known-bad patterns; Copilot bridge as fallback completion source"
NEW: "Two-tier validation: Langium heuristic parsing catches structural errors before presentation, [bbjcpl compiler validation](/docs/ide-integration#compiler-validation) catches semantic errors (undeclared variables, type mismatches) as ground truth; evaluation benchmarks with known-bad patterns; Copilot bridge as fallback completion source"

**2. Training data risk row (second row):**
Replace the existing Mitigation cell for "Training data insufficient for all 4 generations":
OLD: "Prioritize modern generations (BBj GUI + DWC) first where developer activity is highest; expand to legacy generations iteratively based on user demand"
NEW: "Prioritize modern generations (BBj GUI + DWC) first where developer activity is highest; ~10K data points collected of an estimated 50-80K needed; expand to legacy generations iteratively based on user demand and targeted data collection"

**3. Explanatory paragraph after table (around line 220):**
Update the paragraph that begins "The highest-priority risk (medium likelihood, high impact) is model hallucination." Replace the sentence about Langium validation:
OLD: "This is mitigated by the Langium validation layer described in [Chapter 4](/docs/ide-integration) -- every LLM suggestion passes through the same parser that powers the language server's diagnostics. Suggestions that fail syntax validation are silently filtered, ensuring that hallucinated code never reaches the developer."
NEW: "This is mitigated by a two-tier validation strategy described in [Chapter 4](/docs/ide-integration): first, the Langium parser catches structural syntax errors (the same parser that powers the language server's diagnostics), then the bbjcpl compiler provides ground-truth semantic validation for completions that pass parsing. Suggestions that fail either validation tier are silently filtered, ensuring that hallucinated code never reaches the developer."

Do NOT add new risk rows. Do NOT change the MadCap Flare, model size, or ecosystem shift rows.
  </action>
  <verify>Read the risk assessment section and confirm: (1) hallucination row mentions both Langium and bbjcpl; (2) training data row mentions 10K/50-80K; (3) explanatory paragraph describes two-tier validation; (4) no new risk rows added; (5) other rows unchanged.</verify>
  <done>Risk assessment updated with compiler validation as concrete hallucination mitigation and training data row reflects current 10K/50-80K collection state.</done>
