<objective>
Research and write Chapter 1: "The BBj Challenge" -- a complete, standalone chapter explaining why BBj needs a custom AI strategy.

Purpose: This is the foundational argument for the entire strategy. If a reader doesn't understand why generic LLMs fail on BBj, the rest of the strategy lacks motivation. The chapter must make this case clearly for all three audiences (developers, leadership, customers).

Output: A fully written chapter at `docs/01-bbj-challenge/index.mdx` that replaces the current placeholder content.

## Source Material

Read `/Users/beff/_workspace/bbj-ai-strategy/bbj-llm-strategy.md` for domain knowledge. The relevant sections are:
- "The BBj Challenge: Four Generations, One Language" (line ~27-146)
- "Appendix A: BBj Generation Quick Reference" (line ~907-1025)
- "Appendix B: Sample Training Data Format" (line ~1009-1125) -- for understanding code style per generation

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT copy from the source paper. Use it to understand the domain, then rewrite from scratch with fresh framing, deeper explanations, and the patterns established in Phase 2.

## Content Patterns (from Phase 2)

- TL;DR: `:::tip[TL;DR]` admonition at the top
- Decision callouts: `:::info[Decision: ...]` with Choice, Rationale, Alternatives, Status fields
- Mermaid diagrams: ````mermaid` code blocks for architecture/flow diagrams
- BBj code: ````bbj title="..."` fenced blocks with syntax highlighting
- Tabs for code comparison: `<Tabs groupId="bbj-generation">` with `<TabItem>` -- requires blank lines around code blocks inside TabItem (MDX gotcha)

## Writing Voice (from CONTEXT.md)

- Tone: authoritative practitioner -- confident, direct
- Body text is developer-first and technical
- TL;DR blocks carry non-technical audiences
- Mixed perspective: "we" for strategy decisions, "BASIS International" for company background
- State decisions confidently, note alternatives briefly

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Research and write Chapter 1 — The BBj Challenge</name>
  <files>docs/01-bbj-challenge/index.mdx</files>
  <action>
Read the source material at `/Users/beff/_workspace/bbj-ai-strategy/bbj-llm-strategy.md` (especially lines 27-146 and appendices A/B at lines 907-1125) to understand the BBj domain deeply. Then write Chapter 1 from scratch.

**File must be `.mdx`** (not `.md`) because it uses Tabs and TabItem JSX components.

**Required imports at top of file (after frontmatter):**
```mdx
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

**Chapter structure -- follow this outline but use Claude's discretion for exact headings and depth:**

1. **Frontmatter** -- keep existing: sidebar_position: 1, title: "The BBj Challenge", update description if needed

2. **TL;DR block** -- `:::tip[TL;DR]` with 2-3 sentences: BBj spans 4 generations, LLMs have zero training data, custom model needed

3. **Opening** -- Set the scene: BBj is not just obscure, it's a living 40+ year lineage. When developers ask AI for help, they get fabricated code.

4. **Four Generations of BBj** -- Explain each generation:
   - Character UI (1980s-present): Terminal `@(x,y)` positioning, mnemonics, `PRINT/INPUT`
   - Visual PRO/5 (1990s-2000s): Windows GUI with `WINDOW CREATE`, `BUTTON CREATE`, `CTRL()`
   - BBj GUI/Swing (2000s-present): Java Swing with `BBjAPI()`, object references (`!`), callbacks
   - DWC/Browser (2010s-present): Same API as BBj GUI but renders in browser, plus `BBjWebManager`
   - Include a Mermaid timeline or evolution diagram

5. **Cross-Generation Code Comparison** -- THE CENTERPIECE of this chapter. Use `<Tabs groupId="bbj-generation">` to show the SAME task (e.g., "Create a window with a button that responds to a click") in all four generations. This makes the argument visceral -- a reader can SEE how different the generations are.
   - **MDX CRITICAL:** Leave blank lines between `<TabItem>` tags and code blocks
   - Use ````bbj title="..."` for each code block
   - Consider showing 2 different tasks as separate Tab groups (e.g., "Create a window" and "Handle user input") to reinforce the point

6. **Universal vs Generation-Specific** -- Explain that BBj has a shared core (`FOR/NEXT`, `IF/THEN`, file I/O, string functions) that works across all generations, plus generation-specific APIs. Include a table or diagram showing this split.

7. **The Generic LLM Problem** -- Show specifically what happens when you ask ChatGPT/Copilot about BBj:
   - They hallucinate VB-style code (show the hallucinated vs correct code example from the source paper)
   - They don't understand `!` (object refs), `$` (string vars), `#` (field refs)
   - RAG alone cannot fix this -- the model needs to understand the language fundamentally
   - Use a `:::info[Decision: Custom Fine-Tuned Model Required]` callout

8. **Why GitHub Copilot Won't Work** -- Brief section: Copilot is a closed system, doesn't allow custom models. Table comparing Copilot limitations vs BBj needs.

9. **Contrast with webforJ** -- Explain how webforJ (Java-based) works fine with generic LLMs because they know Java. BBj is the opposite. Table comparing webforJ vs BBj AI needs. This section should make clear this is a BBj-specific problem, not a company-wide problem.

10. **Current Status** -- Where things stand: model selection underway, training data structure defined, base model evaluation in progress. Keep honest and grounded.

**Code examples:** Short (3-5 lines), conceptual fragments. All BBj code blocks use ````bbj` language identifier. Show all four generations.

**Mermaid diagrams:** At least one -- the evolution timeline or a comparison diagram.

**Length guidance:** This is the most important "setup" chapter. It should be substantial enough to make the case convincingly -- likely 200-350 lines of MDX. But avoid padding. Every section should earn its place.

- `npm run build` passes
- Chapter content is substantial (150+ lines), not placeholder
- All content patterns used: TL;DR, decision callout, Mermaid, BBj code blocks, Tabs
- Cross-generation comparison shows all 4 BBj generations side by side
- webforJ contrast section exists
- Current Status section exists
- No "Coming Soon" placeholder text remains

<success_criteria>
Chapter 1 stands alone as a convincing argument for why BBj needs custom AI tooling. A reader unfamiliar with BBj finishes the chapter understanding the four generations, why LLMs fail, how webforJ differs, and why a custom model is the only viable path. The chapter uses all established content patterns and renders correctly with syntax highlighting.
