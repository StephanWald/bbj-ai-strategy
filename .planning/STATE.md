# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-31)

**Core value:** Stakeholders can understand the BBj AI strategy, why it's necessary, and how it will be executed -- through a well-structured, publicly accessible documentation site.
**Current focus:** v1.1 Phase 6 -- Fix hallucinated BBj code samples across all chapters.

## Current Position

Milestone: v1.1 Code Corrections & Branding
Phase: 6 of 7 (Code Corrections)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase
Status: In progress -- Plans 01-02 complete, Plan 03 remaining
Last activity: 2026-01-31 -- Completed 06-02-PLAN.md (Chapters 2-6 code corrections)

Progress: [██████         ] 40% (2/5 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 2.5min
- Total execution time: 5min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Duration | Status |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| 06-code-corrections | 2/3 | 5min | In progress |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Use `GuideToGuiProgrammingInBBj.pdf` as authoritative reference for all BBj code corrections
- User has BASIS brand assets available (logo, colors, fonts)
- Code corrections (Phase 6) before branding (Phase 7) -- content integrity is higher priority
- Used lowercase print/open/ctrl in Visual PRO/5 examples to match PDF reference style
- DWC code blocks given same coordinate params as BBj GUI to show API equivalence
- All Visual PRO/5 references use PRINT (sysgui)'WINDOW'(...) mnemonic syntax per PDF reference
- Existing correct code blocks (OrderForm, modern BBj API) verified and left unchanged

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None open.
