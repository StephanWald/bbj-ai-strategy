# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-01)

**Core value:** Stakeholders (developers, leadership, customers) can understand the BBj AI strategy, why it's necessary, and how it will be executed -- through a well-structured, publicly accessible documentation site.
**Current focus:** v1.3 MCP Architecture Integration -- Phase 15 (Strategic Architecture)

## Current Position

Milestone: v1.3 MCP Architecture Integration
Phase: 15 of 19 (Strategic Architecture)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See .planning/PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full log.

Recent decisions:
- MCP architecture woven into existing chapters (not standalone Ch8) -- MCP is the integration layer, not a separate initiative
- Phase numbering continues from v1.2 (Phase 14 was last) -- v1.3 starts at Phase 15
- MCP topology diagram replaces original two-layer architecture overview diagram -- MCP Server sits between clients and backends
- Tool schemas presented as compact JSON Schema format -- language-neutral, matches MCP spec native format
- webforJ precedent kept to one paragraph -- organizational pattern, not belabored

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None open.
