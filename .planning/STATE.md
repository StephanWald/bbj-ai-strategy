## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Split content into Foundation (Ch 1-3) and Execution (Ch 4-7) phases for manageable delivery
- [Roadmap]: BBj Prism syntax highlighting placed in Phase 3 (with first content chapters) rather than Phase 1 (scaffold)
- [01-01]: Docusaurus numberPrefix stripping is default -- doc IDs and URLs exclude numeric folder prefix (e.g., bbj-challenge/index not 01-bbj-challenge/index)
- [01-01]: Migrated onBrokenMarkdownLinks to markdown.hooks for v4 compatibility

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: BBj Prism grammar may not exist -- fallback to `basic` highlighting if custom grammar exceeds effort budget
- [01-01]: Rspack deprecation warning about experiments.lazyBarrel appears during builds -- cosmetic, no action needed
