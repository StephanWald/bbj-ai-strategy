## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See .planning/PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full log.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Python ingestion sub-project as mono-repo directory (keeps scripts co-located with strategy docs)
- Both Flare export and crawl ingestion paths (engineers may or may not have Flare project access)
- Raw Flare XHTML (not Clean XHTML export) -- actual project source at /Users/beff/bbjdocs/ uses MadCap namespace tags

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None open.
