# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-31)

**Core value:** Stakeholders can understand the BBj AI strategy, why it's necessary, and how it will be executed -- through a well-structured, publicly accessible documentation site.
**Current focus:** v1.1 Phase 7 -- Apply BASIS International brand identity to the site.

## Current Position

Milestone: v1.1 Code Corrections & Branding
Phase: 7 of 7 (Custom Branding)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-31 -- Completed 07-01-PLAN.md (brand assets and navbar logo)

Progress: [████████████   ] 80% (4/5 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 2min
- Total execution time: 7min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Duration | Status |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| 06-code-corrections | 3/3 | 6min | Complete (verified) |
| 07-custom-branding | 1/2 | 1min | In progress |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Use `GuideToGuiProgrammingInBBj.pdf` as authoritative reference for all BBj code corrections
- User has BASIS brand assets available (logo, colors, fonts)
- Code corrections (Phase 6) before branding (Phase 7) -- content integrity is higher priority
- Used lowercase print/open/ctrl in Visual PRO/5 examples to match PDF reference style
- DWC code blocks given same coordinate params as BBj GUI to show API equivalence
- All Visual PRO/5 references use PRINT (sysgui)'WINDOW'(...) mnemonic syntax per PDF reference
- Existing correct code blocks (OrderForm, modern BBj API) verified and left unchanged
- PDF reference callout placed after Four Generations section (after DWC subsection) for natural reading flow
- Used general documentation.basis.cloud URL rather than specific PDF path for URL resilience
- Keep favicon.ico alongside favicon.png as fallback for older browsers
- No srcDark logo variant needed (dwc-logo.png has dark background, works in both modes)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None open.
